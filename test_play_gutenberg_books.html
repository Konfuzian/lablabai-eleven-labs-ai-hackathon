A public place.\r\n\r\n\r\n Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nGregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nI mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nI strike quickly, being moved.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou\r\nart moved, thou runn’st away.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand.\r\nI will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThat shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nTrue, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to\r\nthe wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and\r\nthrust his maids to the wall.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\n’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the\r\nmen I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThe heads of the maids?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense\r\nthou wilt.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a\r\npretty piece of flesh.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\n’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.\r\nDraw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.\r\n\r\n Enter Abram and Balthasar.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nMy naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nHow? Turn thy back and run?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nFear me not.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nNo, marry; I fear thee!\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nLet us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nI will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nNay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to\r\nthem if they bear it.\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nIs the law of our side if I say ay?\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nNo sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nDo you quarrel, sir?\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nQuarrel, sir? No, sir.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nBut if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nNo better.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nWell, sir.\r\n\r\n Enter Benvolio.\r\n\r\nGREGORY.\r\nSay better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nYes, better, sir.\r\n\r\nABRAM.\r\nYou lie.\r\n\r\nSAMPSON.\r\nDraw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\r\n\r\n [_They fight._]\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nPart, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.\r\n\r\n [_Beats down their swords._]\r\n\r\n Enter Tybalt.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nWhat, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\r\nTurn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nI do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,\r\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nWhat, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\r\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\r\nHave at thee, coward.\r\n\r\n [_They fight._]\r\n\r\n Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.\r\n\r\nFIRST CITIZEN.\r\nClubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!\r\nDown with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\r\n\r\n Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nA crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\r\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\r\n\r\n Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nThou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.\r\n\r\nLADY MONTAGUE.\r\nThou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\r\n\r\n Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.\r\n\r\nPRINCE.\r\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\r\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—\r\nWill they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,\r\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\r\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\r\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\r\nThrow your mistemper’d weapons to the ground\r\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\r\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\r\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\r\nHave thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,\r\nAnd made Verona’s ancient citizens\r\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\r\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\r\nCanker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.\r\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\r\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\r\nFor this time all the rest depart away:\r\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me,\r\nAnd Montague, come you this afternoon,\r\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\r\nTo old Free-town, our common judgement-place.\r\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,\r\n Citizens and Servants._]\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\r\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nHere were the servants of your adversary\r\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach.\r\nI drew to part them, in the instant came\r\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,\r\nWhich, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,\r\nHe swung about his head, and cut the winds,\r\nWho nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.\r\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\r\nCame more and more, and fought on part and part,\r\nTill the Prince came, who parted either part.\r\n\r\nLADY MONTAGUE.\r\nO where is Romeo, saw you him today?\r\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun\r\nPeer’d forth the golden window of the east,\r\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,\r\nWhere underneath the grove of sycamore\r\nThat westward rooteth from this city side,\r\nSo early walking did I see your son.\r\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me,\r\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood.\r\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\r\nWhich then most sought where most might not be found,\r\nBeing one too many by my weary self,\r\nPursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,\r\nAnd gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\r\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,\r\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\r\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\r\nShould in the farthest east begin to draw\r\nThe shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,\r\nAway from light steals home my heavy son,\r\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\r\nShuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out\r\nAnd makes himself an artificial night.\r\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\r\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nHave you importun’d him by any means?\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nBoth by myself and many other friends;\r\nBut he, his own affections’ counsellor,\r\nIs to himself—I will not say how true—\r\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\r\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\r\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm\r\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\r\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\r\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\r\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\r\n\r\n Enter Romeo.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nSee, where he comes. So please you step aside;\r\nI’ll know his grievance or be much denied.\r\n\r\nMONTAGUE.\r\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay\r\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nGood morrow, cousin.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIs the day so young?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nBut new struck nine.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAy me, sad hours seem long.\r\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNot having that which, having, makes them short.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nIn love?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nOut.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nOf love?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nOut of her favour where I am in love.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAlas that love so gentle in his view,\r\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAlas that love, whose view is muffled still,\r\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\r\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\r\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\r\nHere’s much to do with hate, but more with love:\r\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\r\nO anything, of nothing first create!\r\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\r\nMisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\r\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!\r\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\r\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\r\nDost thou not laugh?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nNo coz, I rather weep.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nGood heart, at what?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nAt thy good heart’s oppression.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhy such is love’s transgression.\r\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\r\nWhich thou wilt propagate to have it prest\r\nWith more of thine. This love that thou hast shown\r\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\r\nLove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\r\nBeing purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;\r\nBeing vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:\r\nWhat is it else? A madness most discreet,\r\nA choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\r\nFarewell, my coz.\r\n\r\n [_Going._]\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nSoft! I will go along:\r\nAnd if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTut! I have lost myself; I am not here.\r\nThis is not Romeo, he’s some other where.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTell me in sadness who is that you love?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nGroan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will,\r\nA word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.\r\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nI aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA right good markman, and she’s fair I love.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWell, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit\r\nWith Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;\r\nAnd in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,\r\nFrom love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.\r\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms\r\nNor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,\r\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\r\nO she’s rich in beauty, only poor\r\nThat when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\r\nFor beauty starv’d with her severity,\r\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\r\nShe is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,\r\nTo merit bliss by making me despair.\r\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\r\nDo I live dead, that live to tell it now.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nBe rul’d by me, forget to think of her.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO teach me how I should forget to think.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\r\nExamine other beauties.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\n’Tis the way\r\nTo call hers, exquisite, in question more.\r\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,\r\nBeing black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;\r\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\r\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost.\r\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,\r\nWhat doth her beauty serve but as a note\r\nWhere I may read who pass’d that passing fair?\r\nFarewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nI’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE II. A Street.\r\n\r\n Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\r\nIn penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,\r\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nOf honourable reckoning are you both,\r\nAnd pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.\r\nBut now my lord, what say you to my suit?\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nBut saying o’er what I have said before.\r\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world,\r\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years;\r\nLet two more summers wither in their pride\r\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\r\n\r\nPARIS.\r\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\r\n\r\nCAPULET.\r\nAnd too soon marr’d are those so early made.\r\nThe earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,\r\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\r\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\r\nMy will to her consent is but a part;\r\nAnd she agree, within her scope of choice\r\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\r\nThis night I hold an old accustom’d feast,\r\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\r\nSuch as I love, and you among the store,\r\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\r\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\r\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\r\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\r\nWhen well apparell’d April on the heel\r\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\r\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\r\nInherit at my house. Hear all, all see,\r\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be:\r\nWhich, on more view of many, mine, being one,\r\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none.\r\nCome, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about\r\nThrough fair Verona; find those persons out\r\nWhose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,\r\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is written that the\r\nshoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the\r\nfisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to\r\nfind those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what\r\nnames the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good\r\ntime!\r\n\r\n Enter Benvolio and Romeo.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,\r\nOne pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;\r\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\r\nOne desperate grief cures with another’s languish:\r\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye,\r\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nYour plantain leaf is excellent for that.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nFor what, I pray thee?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nFor your broken shin.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNot mad, but bound more than a madman is:\r\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\r\nWhipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nGod gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nPerhaps you have learned it without book.\r\nBut I pray, can you read anything you see?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAy, If I know the letters and the language.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nYe say honestly, rest you merry!\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nStay, fellow; I can read.\r\n\r\n [_He reads the letter._]\r\n\r\n_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\r\nCounty Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;\r\nThe lady widow of Utruvio;\r\nSignior Placentio and his lovely nieces;\r\nMercutio and his brother Valentine;\r\nMine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;\r\nMy fair niece Rosaline and Livia;\r\nSignior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;\r\nLucio and the lively Helena. _\r\n\r\n\r\nA fair assembly.

The all-seeing sun\r\nNe’er saw her match since first the world begun.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\r\nHerself pois’d with herself in either eye:\r\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d\r\nYour lady’s love against some other maid\r\nThat I will show you shining at this feast,\r\nAnd she shall scant show well that now shows best.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,\r\nBut to rejoice in splendour of my own.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

Nurse, come back again,\r\nI have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.\r\nThou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nShe’s not fourteen.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nI’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,\r\nAnd yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,\r\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now\r\nTo Lammas-tide?\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nA fortnight and odd days.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\r\nCome Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.\r\nSusan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—\r\nWere of an age. Well, Susan is with God;\r\nShe was too good for me. But as I said,\r\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\r\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\r\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\r\nAnd she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\r\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\r\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\r\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;\r\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua:\r\nNay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,\r\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\r\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\r\nTo see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\r\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,\r\nTo bid me trudge.\r\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\r\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\r\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\r\nFor even the day before she broke her brow,\r\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!\r\nA was a merry man,—took up the child:\r\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?\r\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\r\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,\r\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\r\nTo see now how a jest shall come about.\r\nI warrant, and I should live a thousand years,\r\nI never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;\r\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\r\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\r\nAnd yet I warrant it had upon it brow\r\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\r\nA perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\r\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?\r\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\r\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace\r\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:\r\nAnd I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nMarry, that marry is the very theme\r\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\r\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nAn honour! Were not I thine only nurse,\r\nI would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\r\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\r\nAre made already mothers. By my count\r\nI was your mother much upon these years\r\nThat you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;\r\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nA man, young lady! Lady, such a man\r\nAs all the world—why he’s a man of wax.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nVerona’s summer hath not such a flower.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWhat say you, can you love the gentleman?\r\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast;\r\nRead o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,\r\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.\r\nExamine every married lineament,\r\nAnd see how one another lends content;\r\nAnd what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,\r\nFind written in the margent of his eyes.\r\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\r\nTo beautify him, only lacks a cover:\r\nThe fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride\r\nFor fair without the fair within to hide.\r\nThat book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,\r\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\r\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\r\nBy having him, making yourself no less.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nNo less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\r\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\r\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\r\n\r\n Enter a Servant.\r\n\r\nSERVANT.\r\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady\r\nasked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.\r\nI must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.\r\n\r\nLADY CAPULET.\r\nWe follow thee.\r\n\r\n [_Exit Servant._]\r\n\r\nJuliet, the County stays.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE IV.

It is too rough,\r\nToo rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\r\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\r\nGive me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]\r\nA visor for a visor. What care I\r\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\r\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\r\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\r\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\r\nFor I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\r\nI’ll be a candle-holder and look on,\r\nThe game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:\r\nIf thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\r\nOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest\r\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNay, that’s not so.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nI mean sir, in delay\r\nWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.\r\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\r\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\r\nBut ’tis no wit to go.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nWhy, may one ask?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nAnd so did I.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWell what was yours?\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nThat dreamers often lie.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\r\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\r\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\r\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\r\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\r\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:\r\nHer waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\r\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\r\nHer traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\r\nThe collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;\r\nHer whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\r\nHer waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\r\nNot half so big as a round little worm\r\nPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:\r\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\r\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\r\nTime out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\r\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\r\nThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\r\nO’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\r\nO’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\r\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\r\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\r\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\r\nSometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\r\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\r\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\r\nTickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,\r\nThen dreams he of another benefice:\r\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\r\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\r\nOf breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,\r\nOf healths five fathom deep; and then anon\r\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;\r\nAnd, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\r\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\r\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night;\r\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\r\nWhich, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\r\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\r\nThat presses them, and learns them first to bear,\r\nMaking them women of good carriage:\r\nThis is she,—\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\r\nThou talk’st of nothing.\r\n\r\nMERCUTIO.\r\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\r\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\r\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\r\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\r\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who woos\r\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\r\nAnd, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\r\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\r\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\r\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,\r\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\r\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term\r\nOf a despised life, clos’d in my breast\r\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\r\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\r\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\r\n\r\nBENVOLIO.\r\nStrike, drum.\r\n\r\n [_Exeunt._]\r\n\r\nSCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.\r\n\r\n Musicians waiting.

Forswear it, sight!\r\nFor I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.\r\n\r\nTYBALT.\r\nThis by his voice, should be a Montague.\r\nFetch me my rapier, boy.

That which we call a rose\r\nBy any other name would smell as sweet;\r\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,\r\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\r\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\r\nAnd for thy name, which is no part of thee,\r\nTake all myself.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI take thee at thy word.\r\nCall me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;\r\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night\r\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy a name\r\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\r\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\r\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\r\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nMy ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\r\nOf thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.\r\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nNeither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHow cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\r\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\r\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\r\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWith love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,\r\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\r\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt:\r\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\r\nThan twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,\r\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,\r\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here.\r\nMy life were better ended by their hate\r\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBy whose direction found’st thou out this place?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy love, that first did prompt me to enquire;\r\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\r\nI am no pilot; yet wert thou as far\r\nAs that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,\r\nI should adventure for such merchandise.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,\r\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\r\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.\r\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\r\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment.\r\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,\r\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,\r\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,\r\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\r\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\r\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\r\nI’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,\r\nSo thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.\r\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;\r\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:\r\nBut trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true\r\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\r\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\r\nBut that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,\r\nMy true-love passion; therefore pardon me,\r\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\r\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,\r\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nO swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,\r\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\r\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWhat shall I swear by?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nDo not swear at all.\r\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\r\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\r\nAnd I’ll believe thee.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIf my heart’s dear love,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWell, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\r\nI have no joy of this contract tonight;\r\nIt is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,\r\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\r\nEre one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.\r\nThis bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,\r\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\r\nGood night, good night. As sweet repose and rest\r\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nTh’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\r\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nWould’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBut to be frank and give it thee again.\r\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have;\r\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\r\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\r\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\r\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.\r\n[_Nurse calls within._]\r\nAnon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.\r\nStay but a little, I will come again.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nO blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,\r\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\r\nToo flattering sweet to be substantial.\r\n\r\n Enter Juliet above.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\r\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\r\nThy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,\r\nBy one that I’ll procure to come to thee,\r\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite,\r\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay\r\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\n[_Within._] Madam.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,\r\nI do beseech thee,—\r\n\r\nNURSE.\r\n[_Within._] Madam.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nBy and by I come—\r\nTo cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.\r\nTomorrow will I send.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSo thrive my soul,—\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nA thousand times good night.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\r\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,\r\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\r\n\r\n [_Retiring slowly._]\r\n\r\n Re-enter Juliet, above.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nHist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice\r\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again.\r\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,\r\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\r\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\r\nWith repetition of my Romeo’s name.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name.\r\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,\r\nLike softest music to attending ears.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nRomeo.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nMy nyas?\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nWhat o’clock tomorrow\r\nShall I send to thee?\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nBy the hour of nine.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.\r\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\r\nRemembering how I love thy company.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nAnd I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,\r\nForgetting any other home but this.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\n’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,\r\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,\r\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\r\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\r\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\r\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nI would I were thy bird.\r\n\r\nJULIET.\r\nSweet, so would I:\r\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\r\nGood night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow\r\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nROMEO.\r\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.\r\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.\r\nHence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,\r\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\r\n\r\n [_Exit._]\r\n\r\nSCENE III.

		    "text": "Moby-Dick; or The Whale, by Herman Melville\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. Loomings.\r\n\r\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having\r\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me\r\non shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part\r\nof the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and\r\nregulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about\r\nthe mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever\r\nI find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and\r\nbringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever\r\nmy hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral\r\nprinciple to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and\r\nmethodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to\r\nget to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.\r\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I\r\nquietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they\r\nbut knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,\r\ncherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\r\n\r\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\r\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her\r\nsurf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\r\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\r\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of\r\nland. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\r\n\r\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\r\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\r\ndo you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\r\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\r\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\r\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\r\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\r\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to\r\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\r\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?\r\n\r\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\r\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\r\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\r\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\r\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of\r\nthem—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\r\nand avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell\r\nme, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\r\nthose ships attract them thither?\r\n\r\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\r\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\r\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in\r\nit. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\r\nreveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will\r\ninfallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\r\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\r\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\r\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\r\never.\r\n\r\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\r\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley\r\nof the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his\r\ntrees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were\r\nwithin; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up\r\nfrom yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands\r\nwinds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in\r\ntheir hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and\r\nthough this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this\r\nshepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were\r\nfixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,\r\nwhen for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among\r\nTiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop\r\nof water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel\r\nyour thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon\r\nsuddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy\r\nhim a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian\r\ntrip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a\r\nrobust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?\r\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a\r\nmystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\r\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did\r\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely\r\nall this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that\r\nstory of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild\r\nimage he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that\r\nsame image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image\r\nof the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.\r\n\r\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\r\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my\r\nlungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a\r\npassenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a\r\npurse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers\r\nget sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy\r\nthemselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;\r\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\r\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\r\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\r\nhonorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\r\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\r\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\r\nAnd as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory\r\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I\r\nnever fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously\r\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\r\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\r\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\r\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\r\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\r\n\r\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\r\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\r\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\r\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of\r\nthing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,\r\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\r\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if\r\njust previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\r\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in\r\nawe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\r\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\r\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\r\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\r\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\r\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\r\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t\r\na slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may\r\norder me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\r\none way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or\r\nmetaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\r\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,\r\nand be content.\r\n\r\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\r\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\r\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\r\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and\r\nbeing paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\r\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being\r\npaid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\r\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\r\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\r\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign\r\nourselves to perdition!\r\n\r\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\r\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\r\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\r\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\r\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\r\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\r\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\r\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But\r\nwherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\r\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\r\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\r\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\r\nsome unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,\r\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\r\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in\r\nas a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive\r\nperformances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run\r\nsomething like this:\r\n\r\n“_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._\r\n“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”\r\n\r\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\r\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\r\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short\r\nand easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I\r\ncannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\r\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\r\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\r\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\r\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\r\nand discriminating judgment.\r\n\r\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale\r\nhimself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\r\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\r\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\r\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,\r\nhelped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things\r\nwould not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an\r\neverlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and\r\nland on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\r\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let\r\nme—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of\r\nthe place one lodges in.\r\n\r\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\r\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\r\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\r\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\r\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\r\n\r\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\r\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city\r\nof old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night\r\nin December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little\r\npacket for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching\r\nthat place would offer, till the following Monday.\r\n\r\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\r\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\r\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\r\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\r\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\r\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\r\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\r\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\r\nwas her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the\r\nfirst dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket\r\ndid those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes\r\nto give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did\r\nthat first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\r\nimported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in\r\norder to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\r\nbowsprit?\r\n\r\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\r\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\r\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\r\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\r\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\r\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,\r\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\r\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\r\nnorth with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you\r\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to\r\ninquire the price, and don’t be too particular.\r\n\r\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The\r\nCrossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further\r\non, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came\r\nsuch fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and\r\nice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay\r\nten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,\r\nwhen I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from\r\nhard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\r\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\r\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\r\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t\r\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are\r\nstopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets\r\nthat took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not\r\nthe cheeriest inns.\r\n\r\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\r\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\r\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\r\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\r\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood\r\ninvitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the\r\nuses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble\r\nover an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying\r\nparticles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\r\nGomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then\r\nmust needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and\r\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\r\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of\r\nDoom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\r\npreacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\r\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\r\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’\r\n\r\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\r\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\r\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\r\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\r\nunderneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”\r\n\r\nCoffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought\r\nI. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this\r\nPeter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and\r\nthe place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\r\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\r\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\r\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\r\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\r\n\r\nIt was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\r\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\r\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than\r\never it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,\r\nis a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the\r\nhob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind\r\ncalled Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the\r\nonly copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\r\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the\r\noutside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where\r\nthe frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only\r\nglazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my\r\nmind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are\r\nwindows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t\r\nstop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint\r\nhere and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The\r\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted\r\noff a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth\r\nagainst the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with\r\nhis shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a\r\ncorn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the\r\ntempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken\r\nwrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty\r\nnight; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their\r\noriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\r\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\r\n\r\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\r\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\r\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\r\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\r\norder to keep out this frost?\r\n\r\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\r\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\r\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\r\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\r\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\r\n\r\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\r\nis plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted\r\nfeet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\r\n\r\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\r\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\r\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\r\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\r\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\r\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\r\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\r\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\r\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\r\nEngland hags, had en"

		    "text": "A Room With A View, by E. M. Forster\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\nThe Bertolini\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no\r\nbusiness at all. She promised us south rooms with a view close\r\ntogether, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a\r\ncourtyard, and a long way apart. Oh, Lucy!”\r\n\r\n“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by\r\nthe Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at\r\nthe two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the\r\nrow of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between\r\nthe English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late\r\nPoet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at\r\nthe notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),\r\nthat was the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you\r\nfeel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all\r\nkinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so\r\ntired.”\r\n\r\n“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying\r\ndown her fork.\r\n\r\n“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her\r\nletter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to\r\ndo it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”\r\n\r\n“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard\r\nthat you shouldn’t have a view.”\r\n\r\nLucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me:\r\nof course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first\r\nvacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part\r\nof whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of\r\ngenerosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.\r\n\r\n“No, no. You must have it.”\r\n\r\n“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”\r\n\r\n“She would never forgive _me_.”\r\n\r\nThe ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a\r\nlittle peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness\r\nthey wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one\r\nof them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant\r\nforward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I have a view, I have a view.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them\r\nover for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that\r\nthey would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was\r\nill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy\r\nbuild, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something\r\nchildish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.\r\nWhat exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her\r\nglance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was\r\nprobably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the\r\nswim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then\r\nsaid: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”\r\n\r\n“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.\r\n\r\n“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll\r\nhave yours. We’ll change.”\r\n\r\nThe better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with\r\nthe new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as\r\npossible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the\r\nquestion.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.\r\n\r\n“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again\r\nrepressed her.\r\n\r\n“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And\r\nhe thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,\r\nsaying, “George, persuade them!”\r\n\r\n“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s\r\nnothing else to say.”\r\n\r\nHe did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed\r\nand sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in\r\nfor what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that\r\nwhenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened\r\ntill it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something\r\nquite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the\r\nold man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not\r\nchange? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was\r\npowerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any\r\none so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as\r\nmuch as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who\r\nwere sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs\r\nof the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are\r\ngenteel.”\r\n\r\n“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with\r\nthe meat that she had once censured.\r\n\r\nLucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.\r\n\r\n“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will\r\nmake a change.”\r\n\r\nHardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The\r\ncurtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout\r\nbut attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,\r\ncheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired\r\ndecency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr.\r\nBeebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,\r\nhowever bad the rooms are. Oh!”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett said, with more restraint:\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss\r\nBartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you\r\nhelped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”\r\n\r\nThe clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember\r\nthe ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward\r\npleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by\r\nLucy.\r\n\r\n“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of\r\nspiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her\r\ncousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer\r\nStreet, too, makes it so specially funny.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss\r\nBartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the\r\ncourse of conversation that you have just accepted the living—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you\r\nat Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe\r\nis—’”\r\n\r\n“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer\r\nStreet next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming\r\nneighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe\r\nbowed.\r\n\r\n“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not\r\noften we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”\r\n\r\n“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”\r\n\r\nHe preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than\r\nto Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the\r\ngirl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length\r\nthat she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a\r\nnewcomer, and he was first in the field. “Don’t neglect the country\r\nround,” his advice concluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to\r\nFiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.”\r\n\r\n“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are\r\nwrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”\r\n\r\n“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We\r\nare in luck.”\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People\r\ntold them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams,\r\nhow to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter,\r\nhow much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had\r\ndecided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way\r\nthey looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose\r\nthe voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to Prato.\r\nThat place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in\r\nshaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”\r\n\r\nThe young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then\r\nreturned moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do.\r\nLucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave\r\nher no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when\r\nshe rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous\r\nlittle bow.\r\n\r\nThe father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,\r\nbut by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nShe hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the\r\ncurtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with\r\nmore than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing\r\ngood-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy,\r\nand Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this\r\nattempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.\r\nAnd even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival\r\nthe solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really\r\nItaly?\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which\r\nhad the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.\r\nBeebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and\r\nforwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some\r\ninvisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying. “The\r\nfirst evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a\r\npeculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.”\r\n\r\nHe expressed his regret.\r\n\r\n“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us\r\nat dinner?”\r\n\r\n“Emerson.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a friend of yours?”\r\n\r\n“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will say no more.”\r\n\r\nHe pressed her very slightly, and she said more.\r\n\r\n“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,\r\nLucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation\r\nto people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.\r\nI hope I acted for the best.”\r\n\r\n“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a\r\nfew moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have\r\ncome of accepting.”\r\n\r\n“No _harm_, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”\r\n\r\n“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said\r\ngently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor\r\nexpect you to show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying\r\nexactly what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks\r\nyou would value them. He no more thought of putting you under an\r\nobligation than he thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at\r\nleast, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”\r\n\r\nLucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so\r\nalways hope that people will be nice.”\r\n\r\n“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every\r\npoint of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will\r\ndiffer. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When\r\nhe first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no\r\ntact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he\r\nwill not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him\r\nto our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching\r\nof the lips.\r\n\r\n“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a\r\nnice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his\r\nfather’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a\r\nSocialist.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have\r\naccepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and\r\nsuspicious?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”\r\n\r\n“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent\r\nrudeness?”\r\n\r\nHe replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,\r\nand got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.\r\n\r\n“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why\r\ndidn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I\r\nhaven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as\r\nwell as all dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see\r\ngood in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Lucia—”\r\n\r\n“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally\r\nlaugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”\r\n\r\n“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will\r\napprove of Mr. Beebe.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”\r\n\r\n“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable\r\nworld. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind\r\nthe times.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.\r\n\r\nThere was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval\r\nwas of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy\r\nCorner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not\r\ndetermine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss\r\nBartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am\r\nafraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”\r\n\r\nAnd the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must\r\nbe more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”\r\n\r\nFortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been\r\nsmiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed\r\nto sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to\r\nchatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the\r\ngratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s\r\nhealth, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of\r\nthoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her\r\nsubjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention\r\nthan the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was\r\nproceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real\r\ncatastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when\r\nshe had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea,\r\nthough one better than something else.\r\n\r\n“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so\r\nEnglish.”\r\n\r\n“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson\r\nwas more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”\r\n\r\n“I think he was meaning to be kind.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of\r\ncourse, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could\r\nnot be too careful with a young girl.\r\n\r\nLucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No\r\none was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not\r\nnoticed it.\r\n\r\n“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have\r\nyou ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most\r\nindelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”\r\n\r\n“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty\r\nand delicacy the same?”\r\n\r\n“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are\r\nso difficult, I sometimes think.”\r\n\r\nShe proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking\r\nextremely pleasant.\r\n\r\n“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so\r\nglad. Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing\r\nwhat I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me\r\ncome and ask you. He would be so pleased.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.\r\nThe old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was silent.\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I\r\nmust apologize for my interference.”\r\n\r\nGravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett\r\nreply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with\r\nyours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at\r\nFlorence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to\r\nturn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,\r\nMr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and\r\nthen conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”\r\n\r\nShe raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the\r\ndrawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The\r\nclergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with\r\nher message.\r\n\r\n“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the\r\nacceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”\r\n\r\nMr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”\r\n\r\nThe young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the\r\nfloor, so low were their chairs.\r\n\r\n“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him\r\npersonally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to\r\nhim as soon as he comes out.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came\r\nforth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to\r\nthe delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.\r\n\r\n“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do\r\nto keep polite.”\r\n\r\n“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then\r\nlooking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own\r\nrooms, to write up his philosophic diary.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the\r\nwinds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not\r\nrealize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand\r\nand a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly\r\nrealize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was\r\nreduced to literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy,\r\nshe committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.\r\nFor she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the\r\nhalf-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a\r\nsigh, and said:\r\n\r\n“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will\r\nsuperintend the move.”\r\n\r\n“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”\r\n\r\n“But I would like to help you.”\r\n\r\n“No, dear.”\r\n\r\nCharlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her\r\nlife, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So\r\nLucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in\r\nher which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less\r\ndelicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room\r\nwithout any feeling of joy.\r\n\r\n“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken\r\nthe largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;\r\nbut I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure\r\nyour mother would not like it.”\r\n\r\nLucy was bewildered.\r\n\r\n“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under\r\nan obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in\r\nmy small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a\r\nguarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”\r\n\r\n“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of\r\nlarger and unsuspected issues.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as\r\nshe wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and\r\nwhen she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the\r\nclean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to\r\nsee the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato,\r\nand the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the\r\ndoor, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards\r\nled, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was\r\nthen that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on\r\nwhich was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the\r\nlight of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,\r\nobnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to\r\ndestroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,\r\nsince it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it\r\ncarefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it\r\nclean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed\r\nheavily according to her habit, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\nIn Santa Croce with No Baedeker\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright\r\nbare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are\r\nnot; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini\r\nsport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too,\r\nto fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar\r\nfastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees\r\nand marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling\r\nagainst the embankment of the road.\r\n\r\nOver the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy\r\nforeshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for\r\nsome mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the\r\nwindow. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms\r\nwere overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried\r\nto hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their\r\nfaces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking,\r\nundersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a\r\ngreat-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them\r\nwalked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went\r\nlittle boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar\r\nbecame entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a\r\ncaterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and\r\nsome white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been\r\nfor the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the\r\nroad might never have got clear.\r\n\r\nOver such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and\r\nthe traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of\r\nGiotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing\r\nbut the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as\r\nwell that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on\r\nLucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window\r\nbefore she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the\r\nbest of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin\r\nhad done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the\r\ncrumbs.\r\n\r\nA conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was,\r\nafter all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the\r\nmorning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy\r\nwould rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but,\r\nof course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of\r\ncourse she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy\r\nwould stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!\r\n\r\nAt this point the clever lady broke in.\r\n\r\n“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you\r\ncan neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be\r\nperfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa\r\nBaroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to\r\nschool with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one\r\ntakes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained\r\ntightly behind.”\r\n\r\nMiss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s\r\ndaughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being\r\nso very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a\r\nlong morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be\r\ndelighted.\r\n\r\n“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you\r\nbring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”\r\n\r\nLucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to\r\nsee where Santa Croce was.\r\n\r\n“Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from\r\nBaedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true\r\nItaly—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found\r\nby patient observation.”\r\n\r\nThis sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and\r\nstarted with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.\r\nThe Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right\r\nalong the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the\r\nside streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle\r\nGrazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San\r\nMiniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a\r\nmurderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the\r\nriver were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then\r\nMiss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she\r\nstopped, and she cried:\r\n\r\n“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has\r\nits own smell.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother\r\na distaste to dirt.\r\n\r\n“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes\r\nfor life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at\r\nthat adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple\r\nsoul!”\r\n\r\nSo Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,\r\nshort, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s\r\ngrace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so\r\ncheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,\r\nonly increased the sense of festivity.\r\n\r\n“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never\r\nrepent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true\r\ndemocracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re\r\nshocked.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.\r\nMy father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful\r\nabout Ireland.”\r\n\r\n“I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical\r\nagain now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our\r\nfront door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the\r\nTories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”\r\n\r\n“Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over\r\nthe Weald.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.\r\n\r\n“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very\r\nnicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there\r\nwas?”\r\n\r\n“Very well indeed.”\r\n\r\n“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”\r\n\r\n“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you\r\nhave property in Surrey?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty\r\nacres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her\r\naunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last\r\nname of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street\r\nthe other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And\r\njust as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”\r\n\r\nCertainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the\r\ntower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But\r\nMiss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that\r\nLucy had followed her with no misgivings.\r\n\r\n“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have\r\ntaken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!\r\nWhat are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is\r\nwhat _I_ call an adventure.”\r\n\r\nLucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,\r\nthat they should ask the way there.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, _not_\r\nto look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We\r\nwill simply drift.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,\r\nneither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the\r\ncity abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa,\r\nand became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy\r\nappeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the\r\nliving terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can\r\never stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from\r\nthe garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against\r\ncirclets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more\r\nbeautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her\r\nforward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a\r\nmile.\r\n\r\nThe hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or\r\nrather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste\r\nout of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of\r\nthe paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the\r\ngreat unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,\r\nlarge and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white\r\nfaçade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It\r\nwas Santa Croce. The adventure was over.\r\n\r\n“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to\r\nthem. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into\r\nthe church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”\r\n\r\n“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their\r\nrooms. They were so very kind.”\r\n\r\n“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my\r\nItaly like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to\r\nset an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who\r\ncouldn’t pass it.”\r\n\r\n“What would you ask us?”\r\n\r\nMiss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest\r\nthat she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood\r\nthey reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it\r\nwhen Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:\r\n\r\n“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak\r\nflapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an\r\nold man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.\r\n\r\nLucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The\r\nbeggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that\r\na young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly\r\ninto the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was\r\nreally almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her\r\nlocal-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both\r\ngesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly\r\nbecause Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her\r\nBaedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way\r\nabout in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never\r\nbe in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,\r\ntalking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was\r\nfull of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and\r\nhumiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the\r\nFranciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful\r\nbuilding. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it\r\ncontained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values\r\nshe was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her\r\nwhich they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be\r\nenthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was\r\nno one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved\r\nthe nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one\r\nthat had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.\r\n\r\nThen the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of\r\nacquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the\r\nItalian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into\r\nthe church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and\r\nout of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,\r\nnot to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their\r\nBaedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that\r\novertook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their\r\ncareer by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to\r\nthe Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it\r\nvery slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with\r\ntheir fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then\r\nretreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy\r\nrealized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to\r\nacquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby\r\nstumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr.\r\nRuskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.\r\nProtestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell\r\nheavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.\r\n\r\n“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had\r\ndarted forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the\r\nsunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where\r\nyou ought to be. Intolerable bishop!”\r\n\r\nThe child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful\r\npeople who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him\r\nnot to be superstitious.\r\n\r\n“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,\r\ncold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”\r\n\r\nThe child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.\r\nEmerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an\r\nItalian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the\r\nrescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she\r\nstiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his\r\nknees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.\r\n\r\n“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than\r\nall the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe\r\nin those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of\r\nthe universe—”\r\n\r\nHe paused for a phrase.\r\n\r\n“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.\r\n\r\nIn her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was\r\ndetermined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and,\r\nif possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious\r\nreference to the pleasant rooms.\r\n\r\n“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what\r\nare you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the\r\nchurch?”\r\n\r\n“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss\r\nLavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too\r\nbad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come\r\nin by myself.”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.\r\n\r\n“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the\r\nyoung lady for the first time.\r\n\r\n“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”\r\n\r\n“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded. It’s\r\nworth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. _That’s_ worth minding.”\r\n\r\nLucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not\r\nsure whither it would lead her.\r\n\r\n“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this\r\nwhere the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not\r\nsuppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the\r\nchild, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.\r\nI hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating\r\nwhat you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy;\r\nbut you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead\r\nwhat part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a\r\nreal pleasure.”\r\n\r\nNow, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been\r\nfurious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is\r\ndifficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.\r\nEmerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the\r\nother hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to\r\nbe offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was\r\nat him that she gazed before replying.\r\n\r\n“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you\r\nwill kindly tell me which they are.”\r\n\r\nThe son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to\r\nthe Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt\r\nlike a child in school who had answered a question rightly.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of\r\nthem rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship\r\nGiotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.\r\n\r\n“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;\r\nhow it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before\r\nany taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these\r\nfrescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the\r\nsnares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic,\r\nmore pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge\r\nand technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”\r\n\r\n“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.\r\n“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means\r\nthe workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no\r\ntruth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I\r\ndo, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”\r\n\r\nHe was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,\r\nthe lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted\r\nuneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with\r\nthese men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and\r\nso strange that she could not remember how to behave.\r\n\r\n“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”\r\n\r\nGeorge replied:\r\n\r\n“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to\r\nheaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should\r\nlike my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”\r\n\r\n“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie\r\nat peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as\r\nsurely as our work survives.”\r\n\r\n“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint,\r\nwhoever he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two\r\nparties. We will incommode you no longer.”\r\n\r\nThe lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,\r\nfor they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They\r\nfiled out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little\r\nold ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine\r\nAlan.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”\r\n\r\nThe procession disappeared without a word.\r\n\r\nSoon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the\r\nlife of St. Francis.\r\n\r\n“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”\r\n\r\nGeorge went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I\r\ndon’t remember.”\r\n\r\n“Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr.\r\nEager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go\r\nand say we are sorry. Hadn’t I better? Then perhaps he will come back.”\r\n\r\n“He will not come back,” said George.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the\r\nRev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear\r\nthe lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old\r\nman, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every\r\nlittle contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.\r\n\r\n“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He\r\nwill try to be kind.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.\r\n\r\n“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people\r\nbecause he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or\r\nfrightened.”\r\n\r\n“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I\r\nthink that a kind action done tactfully—”\r\n\r\n“Tact!”\r\n\r\nHe threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong\r\nanswer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.\r\nFor a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon\r\nit—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again\r\nat Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of\r\nacorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,\r\nof tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon\r\npassed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born\r\nof silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,\r\nand she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone\r\nfamiliar to her.\r\n\r\n“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.\r\n\r\n“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They\r\nwon’t come back.”\r\n\r\n“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in\r\nothers...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on\r\nSt. Francis came floating round the partition wall.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at\r\nthose saints?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone\r\nthat is praised in Ruskin?”\r\n\r\nHe did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.\r\nGeorge, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man\r\nwandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a\r\nbarn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were\r\nalso beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old\r\nlady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his\r\nMass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half\r\ninterested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had\r\nimpaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.\r\n\r\n“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about\r\nhis tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the\r\nwhole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”\r\n\r\nLucy again felt that this did not do.\r\n\r\n“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.\r\n\r\n“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to\r\ngive him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the\r\nsuperstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the\r\nname of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to\r\ngrow up happy.”\r\n\r\nShe was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old\r\nman, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother\r\nmight not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte\r\nwould object most strongly.\r\n\r\n“What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday\r\nto Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to\r\nhave been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What\r\ndid you say?”\r\n\r\nLucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:\r\n\r\n“Now don’t be stupid over this. I don’t require you to fall in love\r\nwith my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are\r\nnearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.\r\nYou might help me. He has known so few women, and you have the time.\r\nYou stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are\r\ninclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself\r\ngo. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,\r\nand spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By\r\nunderstanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be\r\ngood for both of you.”\r\n\r\nTo this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.\r\n\r\n“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.”\r\n\r\n“And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.\r\n\r\n“The old trouble; things won’t fit.”\r\n\r\n“What things?”\r\n\r\n“The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”\r\n\r\nIn his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting\r\npoetry, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘From far, from eve and morning,\r\n    And yon twelve-winded sky,\r\nThe stuff of life to knit me\r\n    Blew hither: here am I’\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that\r\nwe come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life\r\nis perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But\r\nwhy should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and\r\nwork and rejoice. I don’t believe in this world sorrow.”\r\n\r\nMiss Honeychurch assented.\r\n\r\n“Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of\r\nthe everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a\r\nYes.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy\r\nbecause the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangl"

beauty’s rose might never die,\r\nBut as the riper should by time decease,\r\nHis tender heir might bear his memory:\r\nBut thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,\r\nFeed’st thy light’s flame with self-substantial fuel,\r\nMaking a famine where abundance lies,\r\nThyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:\r\nThou that art now the world’s fresh ornament,\r\nAnd only herald to the gaudy spring,\r\nWithin thine own bud buriest thy content,\r\nAnd, tender churl, mak’st waste in niggarding:\r\n  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,\r\n  To eat the world’s due, by the grave and thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2\r\n\r\nWhen forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\r\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,\r\nThy youth’s proud livery so gazed on now,\r\nWill be a tattered weed of small worth held:\r\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\r\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\r\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\r\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\r\nHow much more praise deserv’d thy beauty’s use,\r\nIf thou couldst answer ‘This fair child of mine\r\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,’\r\nProving his beauty by succession thine.\r\n  This were to be new made when thou art old,\r\n  And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    3\r\n\r\nLook in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,\r\nNow is the time that face should form another,\r\nWhose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,\r\nThou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.\r\nFor where is she so fair whose uneared womb\r\nDisdains the tillage of thy husbandry?\r\nOr who is he so fond will be the tomb\r\nOf his self-love to stop posterity?\r\nThou art thy mother’s glass and she in thee\r\nCalls back the lovely April of her prime,\r\nSo thou through windows of thine age shalt see,\r\nDespite of wrinkles this thy golden time.\r\n  But if thou live remembered not to be,\r\n  Die single and thine image dies with thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    4\r\n\r\nUnthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,\r\nUpon thyself thy beauty’s legacy?\r\nNature’s bequest gives nothing but doth lend,\r\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\r\nThen beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,\r\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?\r\nProfitless usurer why dost thou use\r\nSo great a sum of sums yet canst not live?\r\nFor having traffic with thyself alone,\r\nThou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive,\r\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\r\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?\r\n  Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\r\n  Which used lives th’ executor to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    5\r\n\r\nThose hours that with gentle work did frame\r\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell\r\nWill play the tyrants to the very same,\r\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel:\r\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\r\nTo hideous winter and confounds him there,\r\nSap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,\r\nBeauty o’er-snowed and bareness every where:\r\nThen were not summer’s distillation left\r\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\r\nBeauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,\r\nNor it nor no remembrance what it was.\r\n  But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,\r\n  Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    6\r\n\r\nThen let not winter’s ragged hand deface,\r\nIn thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:\r\nMake sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,\r\nWith beauty’s treasure ere it be self-killed:\r\nThat use is not forbidden usury,\r\nWhich happies those that pay the willing loan;\r\nThat’s for thyself to breed another thee,\r\nOr ten times happier be it ten for one,\r\nTen times thyself were happier than thou art,\r\nIf ten of thine ten times refigured thee:\r\nThen what could death do if thou shouldst depart,\r\nLeaving thee living in posterity?\r\n  Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,\r\n  To be death’s conquest and make worms thine heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    7\r\n\r\nLo in the orient when the gracious light\r\nLifts up his burning head, each under eye\r\nDoth homage to his new-appearing sight,\r\nServing with looks his sacred majesty,\r\nAnd having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,\r\nResembling strong youth in his middle age,\r\nYet mortal looks adore his beauty still,\r\nAttending on his golden pilgrimage:\r\nBut when from highmost pitch with weary car,\r\nLike feeble age he reeleth from the day,\r\nThe eyes (fore duteous) now converted are\r\nFrom his low tract and look another way:\r\n  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon:\r\n  Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    8\r\n\r\nMusic to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?\r\nSweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:\r\nWhy lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,\r\nOr else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?\r\nIf the true concord of well-tuned sounds,\r\nBy unions married do offend thine ear,\r\nThey do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds\r\nIn singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:\r\nMark how one string sweet husband to another,\r\nStrikes each in each by mutual ordering;\r\nResembling sire, and child, and happy mother,\r\nWho all in one, one pleasing note do sing:\r\n  Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,\r\n  Sings this to thee, ‘Thou single wilt prove none’.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    9\r\n\r\nIs it for fear to wet a widow’s eye,\r\nThat thou consum’st thyself in single life?\r\nAh, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,\r\nThe world will wail thee like a makeless wife,\r\nThe world will be thy widow and still weep,\r\nThat thou no form of thee hast left behind,\r\nWhen every private widow well may keep,\r\nBy children’s eyes, her husband’s shape in mind:\r\nLook what an unthrift in the world doth spend\r\nShifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;\r\nBut beauty’s waste hath in the world an end,\r\nAnd kept unused the user so destroys it:\r\n  No love toward others in that bosom sits\r\n  That on himself such murd’rous shame commits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    10\r\n\r\nFor shame deny that thou bear’st love to any\r\nWho for thyself art so unprovident.\r\nGrant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,\r\nBut that thou none lov’st is most evident:\r\nFor thou art so possessed with murd’rous hate,\r\nThat ’gainst thyself thou stick’st not to conspire,\r\nSeeking that beauteous roof to ruinate\r\nWhich to repair should be thy chief desire:\r\nO change thy thought, that I may change my mind,\r\nShall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?\r\nBe as thy presence is gracious and kind,\r\nOr to thyself at least kind-hearted prove,\r\n  Make thee another self for love of me,\r\n  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    11\r\n\r\nAs fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow’st,\r\nIn one of thine, from that which thou departest,\r\nAnd that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow’st,\r\nThou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,\r\nHerein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,\r\nWithout this folly, age, and cold decay,\r\nIf all were minded so, the times should cease,\r\nAnd threescore year would make the world away:\r\nLet those whom nature hath not made for store,\r\nHarsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:\r\nLook whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;\r\nWhich bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:\r\n  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,\r\n  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    12\r\n\r\nWhen I do count the clock that tells the time,\r\nAnd see the brave day sunk in hideous night,\r\nWhen I behold the violet past prime,\r\nAnd sable curls all silvered o’er with white:\r\nWhen lofty trees I see barren of leaves,\r\nWhich erst from heat did canopy the herd\r\nAnd summer’s green all girded up in sheaves\r\nBorne on the bier with white and bristly beard:\r\nThen of thy beauty do I question make\r\nThat thou among the wastes of time must go,\r\nSince sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,\r\nAnd die as fast as they see others grow,\r\n  And nothing ’gainst Time’s scythe can make defence\r\n  Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    13\r\n\r\nO that you were your self, but love you are\r\nNo longer yours, than you yourself here live,\r\nAgainst this coming end you should prepare,\r\nAnd your sweet semblance to some other give.\r\nSo should that beauty which you hold in lease\r\nFind no determination, then you were\r\nYourself again after yourself’s decease,\r\nWhen your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.\r\nWho lets so fair a house fall to decay,\r\nWhich husbandry in honour might uphold,\r\nAgainst the stormy gusts of winter’s day\r\nAnd barren rage of death’s eternal cold?\r\n  O none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,\r\n  You had a father, let your son say so.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    14\r\n\r\nNot from the stars do I my judgement pluck,\r\nAnd yet methinks I have astronomy,\r\nBut not to tell of good, or evil luck,\r\nOf plagues, of dearths, or seasons’ quality,\r\nNor can I fortune to brief minutes tell;\r\nPointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,\r\nOr say with princes if it shall go well\r\nBy oft predict that I in heaven find.\r\nBut from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,\r\nAnd constant stars in them I read such art\r\nAs truth and beauty shall together thrive\r\nIf from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert:\r\n  Or else of thee this I prognosticate,\r\n  Thy end is truth’s and beauty’s doom and date.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    15\r\n\r\nWhen I consider everything that grows\r\nHolds in perfection but a little moment.\r\nThat this huge stage presenteth nought but shows\r\nWhereon the stars in secret influence comment.\r\nWhen I perceive that men as plants increase,\r\nCheered and checked even by the self-same sky:\r\nVaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,\r\nAnd wear their brave state out of memory.\r\nThen the conceit of this inconstant stay,\r\nSets you most rich in youth before my sight,\r\nWhere wasteful Time debateth with Decay\r\nTo change your day of youth to sullied night,\r\n  And all in war with Time for love of you,\r\n  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    16\r\n\r\nBut wherefore do not you a mightier way\r\nMake war upon this bloody tyrant Time?\r\nAnd fortify yourself in your decay\r\nWith means more blessed than my barren rhyme?\r\nNow stand you on the top of happy hours,\r\nAnd many maiden gardens yet unset,\r\nWith virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,\r\nMuch liker than your painted counterfeit:\r\nSo should the lines of life that life repair\r\nWhich this (Time’s pencil) or my pupil pen\r\nNeither in inward worth nor outward fair\r\nCan make you live yourself in eyes of men.\r\n  To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,\r\n  And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    17\r\n\r\nWho will believe my verse in time to come\r\nIf it were filled with your most high deserts?\r\nThough yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb\r\nWhich hides your life, and shows not half your parts:\r\nIf I could write the beauty of your eyes,\r\nAnd in fresh numbers number all your graces,\r\nThe age to come would say this poet lies,\r\nSuch heavenly touches ne’er touched earthly faces.\r\nSo should my papers (yellowed with their age)\r\nBe scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,\r\nAnd your true rights be termed a poet’s rage,\r\nAnd stretched metre of an antique song.\r\n  But were some child of yours alive that time,\r\n  You should live twice,—in it, and in my rhyme.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    18\r\n\r\nShall I compare thee to a summer’s day?\r\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\r\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\r\nAnd summer’s lease hath all too short a date:\r\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\r\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimmed,\r\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\r\nBy chance, or nature’s changing course untrimmed:\r\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade,\r\nNor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,\r\nNor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,\r\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st,\r\n  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\r\n  So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    19\r\n\r\nDevouring Time blunt thou the lion’s paws,\r\nAnd make the earth devour her own sweet brood,\r\nPluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger’s jaws,\r\nAnd burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,\r\nMake glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet’st,\r\nAnd do whate’er thou wilt swift-footed Time\r\nTo the wide world and all her fading sweets:\r\nBut I forbid thee one most heinous crime,\r\nO carve not with thy hours my love’s fair brow,\r\nNor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,\r\nHim in thy course untainted do allow,\r\nFor beauty’s pattern to succeeding men.\r\n  Yet do thy worst, old Time; despite thy wrong,\r\n  My love shall in my verse ever live young.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    20\r\n\r\nA woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,\r\nHast thou the master mistress of my passion,\r\nA woman’s gentle heart but not acquainted\r\nWith shifting change as is false women’s fashion,\r\nAn eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:\r\nGilding the object whereupon it gazeth,\r\nA man in hue all hues in his controlling,\r\nWhich steals men’s eyes and women’s souls amazeth.\r\nAnd for a woman wert thou first created,\r\nTill nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,\r\nAnd by addition me of thee defeated,\r\nBy adding one thing to my purpose nothing.\r\n  But since she pricked thee out for women’s pleasure,\r\n  Mine be thy love and thy love’s use their treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    21\r\n\r\nSo is it not with me as with that muse,\r\nStirred by a painted beauty to his verse,\r\nWho heaven it self for ornament doth use,\r\nAnd every fair with his fair doth rehearse,\r\nMaking a couplement of proud compare\r\nWith sun and moon, with earth and sea’s rich gems:\r\nWith April’s first-born flowers and all things rare,\r\nThat heaven’s air in this huge rondure hems.\r\nO let me true in love but truly write,\r\nAnd then believe me, my love is as fair,\r\nAs any mother’s child, though not so bright\r\nAs those gold candles fixed in heaven’s air:\r\n  Let them say more that like of hearsay well,\r\n  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    22\r\n\r\nMy glass shall not persuade me I am old,\r\nSo long as youth and thou are of one date,\r\nBut when in thee time’s furrows I behold,\r\nThen look I death my days should expiate.\r\nFor all that beauty that doth cover thee,\r\nIs but the seemly raiment of my heart,\r\nWhich in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,\r\nHow can I then be elder than thou art?\r\nO therefore love be of thyself so wary,\r\nAs I not for my self, but for thee will,\r\nBearing thy heart which I will keep so chary\r\nAs tender nurse her babe from faring ill.\r\n  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,\r\n  Thou gav’st me thine not to give back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    23\r\n\r\nAs an unperfect actor on the stage,\r\nWho with his fear is put beside his part,\r\nOr some fierce thing replete with too much rage,\r\nWhose strength’s abundance weakens his own heart;\r\nSo I for fear of trust, forget to say,\r\nThe perfect ceremony of love’s rite,\r\nAnd in mine own love’s strength seem to decay,\r\nO’ercharged with burthen of mine own love’s might:\r\nO let my looks be then the eloquence,\r\nAnd dumb presagers of my speaking breast,\r\nWho plead for love, and look for recompense,\r\nMore than that tongue that more hath more expressed.\r\n  O learn to read what silent love hath writ,\r\n  To hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    24\r\n\r\nMine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,\r\nThy beauty’s form in table of my heart,\r\nMy body is the frame wherein ’tis held,\r\nAnd perspective it is best painter’s art.\r\nFor through the painter must you see his skill,\r\nTo find where your true image pictured lies,\r\nWhich in my bosom’s shop is hanging still,\r\nThat hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:\r\nNow see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,\r\nMine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me\r\nAre windows to my breast, where-through the sun\r\nDelights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;\r\n  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,\r\n  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    25\r\n\r\nLet those who are in favour with their stars,\r\nOf public honour and proud titles boast,\r\nWhilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars\r\nUnlooked for joy in that I honour most;\r\nGreat princes’ favourites their fair leaves spread,\r\nBut as the marigold at the sun’s eye,\r\nAnd in themselves their pride lies buried,\r\nFor at a frown they in their glory die.\r\nThe painful warrior famoused for fight,\r\nAfter a thousand victories once foiled,\r\nIs from the book of honour razed quite,\r\nAnd all the rest forgot for which he toiled:\r\n  Then happy I that love and am beloved\r\n  Where I may not remove nor be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    26\r\n\r\nLord of my love, to whom in vassalage\r\nThy merit hath my duty strongly knit;\r\nTo thee I send this written embassage\r\nTo witness duty, not to show my wit.\r\nDuty so great, which wit so poor as mine\r\nMay make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;\r\nBut that I hope some good conceit of thine\r\nIn thy soul’s thought (all naked) will bestow it:\r\nTill whatsoever star that guides my moving,\r\nPoints on me graciously with fair aspect,\r\nAnd puts apparel on my tattered loving,\r\nTo show me worthy of thy sweet respect,\r\n  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,\r\n  Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    27\r\n\r\nWeary with toil, I haste me to my bed,\r\nThe dear respose for limbs with travel tired,\r\nBut then begins a journey in my head\r\nTo work my mind, when body’s work’s expired.\r\nFor then my thoughts, from far where I abide,\r\nIntend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,\r\nAnd keep my drooping eyelids open wide,\r\nLooking on darkness which the blind do see.\r\nSave that my soul’s imaginary sight\r\nPresents thy shadow to my sightless view,\r\nWhich like a jewel (hung in ghastly night)\r\nMakes black night beauteous, and her old face new.\r\n  Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,\r\n  For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    28\r\n\r\nHow can I then return in happy plight\r\nThat am debarred the benefit of rest?\r\nWhen day’s oppression is not eased by night,\r\nBut day by night and night by day oppressed.\r\nAnd each (though enemies to either’s reign)\r\nDo in consent shake hands to torture me,\r\nThe one by toil, the other to complain\r\nHow far I toil, still farther off from thee.\r\nI tell the day to please him thou art bright,\r\nAnd dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:\r\nSo flatter I the swart-complexioned night,\r\nWhen sparkling stars twire not thou gild’st the even.\r\n  But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,\r\n  And night doth nightly make grief’s length seem stronger\r\n\r\n\r\n                    29\r\n\r\nWhen in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,\r\nI all alone beweep my outcast state,\r\nAnd trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\r\nAnd look upon my self and curse my fate,\r\nWishing me like to one more rich in hope,\r\nFeatured like him, like him with friends possessed,\r\nDesiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,\r\nWith what I most enjoy contented least,\r\nYet in these thoughts my self almost despising,\r\nHaply I think on thee, and then my state,\r\n(Like to the lark at break of day arising\r\nFrom sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate,\r\n  For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,\r\n  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    30\r\n\r\nWhen to the sessions of sweet silent thought,\r\nI summon up remembrance of things past,\r\nI sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,\r\nAnd with old woes new wail my dear time’s waste:\r\nThen can I drown an eye (unused to flow)\r\nFor precious friends hid in death’s dateless night,\r\nAnd weep afresh love’s long since cancelled woe,\r\nAnd moan th’ expense of many a vanished sight.\r\nThen can I grieve at grievances foregone,\r\nAnd heavily from woe to woe tell o’er\r\nThe sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,\r\nWhich I new pay as if not paid before.\r\n  But if the while I think on thee (dear friend)\r\n  All losses are restored, and sorrows end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    31\r\n\r\nThy bosom is endeared with all hearts,\r\nWhich I by lacking have supposed dead,\r\nAnd there reigns love and all love’s loving parts,\r\nAnd all those friends which I thought buried.\r\nHow many a holy and obsequious tear\r\nHath dear religious love stol’n from mine eye,\r\nAs interest of the dead, which now appear,\r\nBut things removed that hidden in thee lie.\r\nThou art the grave where buried love doth live,\r\nHung with the trophies of my lovers gone,\r\nWho all their parts of me to thee did give,\r\nThat due of many, now is thine alone.\r\n  Their images I loved, I view in thee,\r\n  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    32\r\n\r\nIf thou survive my well-contented day,\r\nWhen that churl death my bones with dust shall cover\r\nAnd shalt by fortune once more re-survey\r\nThese poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:\r\nCompare them with the bett’ring of the time,\r\nAnd though they be outstripped by every pen,\r\nReserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,\r\nExceeded by the height of happier men.\r\nO then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,\r\n’Had my friend’s Muse grown with this growing age,\r\nA dearer birth than this his love had brought\r\nTo march in ranks of better equipage:\r\n  But since he died and poets better prove,\r\n  Theirs for their style I’ll read, his for his love’.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    33\r\n\r\nFull many a glorious morning have I seen,\r\nFlatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,\r\nKissing with golden face the meadows green;\r\nGilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:\r\nAnon permit the basest clouds to ride,\r\nWith ugly rack on his celestial face,\r\nAnd from the forlorn world his visage hide\r\nStealing unseen to west with this disgrace:\r\nEven so my sun one early morn did shine,\r\nWith all triumphant splendour on my brow,\r\nBut out alack, he was but one hour mine,\r\nThe region cloud hath masked him from me now.\r\n  Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,\r\n  Suns of the world may stain, when heaven’s sun staineth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    34\r\n\r\nWhy didst thou promise such a beauteous day,\r\nAnd make me travel forth without my cloak,\r\nTo let base clouds o’ertake me in my way,\r\nHiding thy brav’ry in their rotten smoke?\r\n’Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,\r\nTo dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,\r\nFor no man well of such a salve can speak,\r\nThat heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:\r\nNor can thy shame give physic to my grief,\r\nThough thou repent, yet I have still the loss,\r\nTh’ offender’s sorrow lends but weak relief\r\nTo him that bears the strong offence’s cross.\r\n  Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,\r\n  And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    35\r\n\r\nNo more be grieved at that which thou hast done,\r\nRoses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,\r\nClouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\r\nAnd loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.\r\nAll men make faults, and even I in this,\r\nAuthorizing thy trespass with compare,\r\nMy self corrupting salving thy amiss,\r\nExcusing thy sins more than thy sins are:\r\nFor to thy sensual fault I bring in sense;\r\nThy adverse party is thy advocate,\r\nAnd ’gainst my self a lawful plea commence:\r\nSuch civil war is in my love and hate,\r\n  That I an accessary needs must be,\r\n  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    36\r\n\r\nLet me confess that we two must be twain,\r\nAlthough our undivided loves are one:\r\nSo shall those blots that do with me remain,\r\nWithout thy help, by me be borne alone.\r\nIn our two loves there is but one respect,\r\nThough in our lives a separable spite,\r\nWhich though it alter not love’s sole effect,\r\nYet doth it steal sweet hours from love’s delight.\r\nI may not evermore acknowledge thee,\r\nLest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,\r\nNor thou with public kindness honour me,\r\nUnless thou take that honour from thy name:\r\n  But do not so, I love thee in such sort,\r\n  As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    37\r\n\r\nAs a decrepit father takes delight,\r\nTo see his active child do deeds of youth,\r\nSo I, made lame by Fortune’s dearest spite\r\nTake all my comfort of thy worth and truth.\r\nFor whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,\r\nOr any of these all, or all, or more\r\nEntitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,\r\nI make my love engrafted to this store:\r\nSo then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,\r\nWhilst that this shadow doth such substance give,\r\nThat I in thy abundance am sufficed,\r\nAnd by a part of all thy glory live:\r\n  Look what is best, that best I wish in thee,\r\n  This wish I have, then ten times happy me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    38\r\n\r\nHow can my muse want subject to invent\r\nWhile thou dost breathe that pour’st into my verse,\r\nThine own sweet argument, too excellent,\r\nFor every vulgar paper to rehearse?\r\nO give thyself the thanks if aught in me,\r\nWorthy perusal stand against thy sight,\r\nFor who’s so dumb that cannot write to thee,\r\nWhen thou thyself dost give invention light?\r\nBe thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth\r\nThan those old nine which rhymers invocate,\r\nAnd he that calls on thee, let him bring forth\r\nEternal numbers to outlive long date.\r\n  If my slight muse do please these curious days,\r\n  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    39\r\n\r\nO how thy worth with manners may I sing,\r\nWhen thou art all the better part of me?\r\nWhat can mine own praise to mine own self bring:\r\nAnd what is’t but mine own when I praise thee?\r\nEven for this, let us divided live,\r\nAnd our dear love lose name of single one,\r\nThat by this separation I may give:\r\nThat due to thee which thou deserv’st alone:\r\nO absence what a torment wouldst thou prove,\r\nWere it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,\r\nTo entertain the time with thoughts of love,\r\nWhich time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.\r\n  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,\r\n  By praising him here who doth hence remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    40\r\n\r\nTake all my loves, my love, yea take them all,\r\nWhat hast thou then more than thou hadst before?\r\nNo love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,\r\nAll mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:\r\nThen if for my love, thou my love receivest,\r\nI cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,\r\nBut yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest\r\nBy wilful taste of what thyself refusest.\r\nI do forgive thy robbery gentle thief\r\nAlthough thou steal thee all my poverty:\r\nAnd yet love knows it is a greater grief\r\nTo bear greater wrong, than hate’s known injury.\r\n  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,\r\n  Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    41\r\n\r\nThose pretty wrongs that liberty commits,\r\nWhen I am sometime absent from thy heart,\r\nThy beauty, and thy years full well befits,\r\nFor still temptation follows where thou art.\r\nGentle thou art, and therefore to be won,\r\nBeauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.\r\nAnd when a woman woos, what woman’s son,\r\nWill sourly leave her till he have prevailed?\r\nAy me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,\r\nAnd chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,\r\nWho lead thee in their riot even there\r\nWhere thou art forced to break a twofold truth:\r\n  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,\r\n  Thine by thy beauty being false to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    42\r\n\r\nThat thou hast her it is not all my grief,\r\nAnd yet it may be said I loved her dearly,\r\nThat she hath thee is of my wailing chief,\r\nA loss in love that touches me more nearly.\r\nLoving offenders thus I will excuse ye,\r\nThou dost love her, because thou know’st I love her,\r\nAnd for my sake even so doth she abuse me,\r\nSuff’ring my friend for my sake to approve her.\r\nIf I lose thee, my loss is my love’s gain,\r\nAnd losing her, my friend hath found that loss,\r\nBoth find each other, and I lose both twain,\r\nAnd both for my sake lay on me this cross,\r\n  But here’s the joy, my friend and I are one,\r\n  Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    43\r\n\r\nWhen most I wink then do mine eyes best see,\r\nFor all the day they view things unrespected,\r\nBut when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,\r\nAnd darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.\r\nThen thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright\r\nHow would thy shadow’s form, form happy show,\r\nTo the clear day with thy much clearer light,\r\nWhen to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!\r\nHow would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,\r\nBy looking on thee in the living day,\r\nWhen in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,\r\nThrough heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!\r\n  All days are nights to see till I see thee,\r\n  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    44\r\n\r\nIf the dull substance of my flesh were thought,\r\nInjurious distance should not stop my way,\r\nFor then despite of space I would be brought,\r\nFrom limits far remote, where thou dost stay,\r\nNo matter then although my foot did stand\r\nUpon the farthest earth removed from thee,\r\nFor nimble thought can jump both sea and land,\r\nAs soon as think the place where he would be.\r\nBut ah, thought kills me that I am not thought\r\nTo leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,\r\nBut that so much of earth and water wrought,\r\nI must attend, time’s leisure with my moan.\r\n  Receiving nought by elements so slow,\r\n  But heavy tears, badges of either’s woe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    45\r\n\r\nThe other two, slight air, and purging fire,\r\nAre both with thee, wherever I abide,\r\nThe first my thought, the other my desire,\r\nThese present-absent with swift motion slide.\r\nFor when these quicker elements are gone\r\nIn tender embassy of love to thee,\r\nMy life being made of four, with two alone,\r\nSinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.\r\nUntil life’s composition be recured,\r\nBy those swift messengers returned from thee,\r\nWho even but now come back again assured,\r\nOf thy fair health, recounting it to me.\r\n  This told, I joy, but then no longer glad,\r\n  I send them back again and straight grow sad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    46\r\n\r\nMine eye and heart are at a mortal war,\r\nHow to divide the conquest of thy sight,\r\nMine eye, my heart thy picture’s sight would bar,\r\nMy heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,\r\nMy heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,\r\nA closet never pierced with crystal eyes;\r\nBut the defendant doth that plea deny,\r\nAnd says in him thy fair appearance lies.\r\nTo side this title is impanelled\r\nA quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,\r\nAnd by their verdict is determined\r\nThe clear eye’s moiety, and the dear heart’s part.\r\n  As thus, mine eye’s due is thy outward part,\r\n  And my heart’s right, thy inward love of heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    47\r\n\r\nBetwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,\r\nAnd each doth good turns now unto the other,\r\nWhen that mine eye is famished for a look,\r\nOr heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;\r\nWith my love’s picture then my eye doth feast,\r\nAnd to the painted banquet bids my heart:\r\nAnother time mine eye is my heart’s guest,\r\nAnd in his thoughts of love doth share a part.\r\nSo either by thy picture or my love,\r\nThyself away, art present still with me,\r\nFor thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,\r\nAnd I am still with them, and they with thee.\r\n  Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight\r\n  Awakes my heart, to heart’s and eye’s delight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    48\r\n\r\nHow careful was I when I took my way,\r\nEach trifle under truest bars to thrust,\r\nThat to my use it might unused stay\r\nFrom hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!\r\nBut thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,\r\nMost worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,\r\nThou best of dearest, and mine only care,\r\nArt left the prey of every vulgar thief.\r\nThee have I not locked up in any chest,\r\nSave where thou art not, though I feel thou art,\r\nWithin the gentle closure of my breast,\r\nFrom whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,\r\n  And even thence thou wilt be stol’n I fear,\r\n  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    49\r\n\r\nAgainst that time (if ever that time come)\r\nWhen I shall see thee frown on my defects,\r\nWhen as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,\r\nCalled to that audit by advised respects,\r\nAgainst that time when thou shalt strangely pass,\r\nAnd scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,\r\nWhen love converted from the thing it was\r\nShall reasons find of settled gravity;\r\nAgainst that time do I ensconce me here\r\nWithin the knowledge of mine own desert,\r\nAnd this my hand, against my self uprear,\r\nTo guard the lawful reasons on thy part,\r\n  To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,\r\n  Since why to love, I can allege no cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    50\r\n\r\nHow heavy do I journey on the way,\r\nWhen what I seek (my weary travel’s end)\r\nDoth teach that case and that repose to say\r\n’Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.’\r\nThe beast that bears me, tired with my woe,\r\nPlods dully on, to bear that weight in me,\r\nAs if by some instinct the wretch did know\r\nHis rider loved not speed being made from thee:\r\nThe bloody spur cannot provoke him on,\r\nThat sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,\r\nWhich heavily he answers with a groan,\r\nMore sharp to me than spurring to his side,\r\n  For that same groan doth put this in my mind,\r\n  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    51\r\n\r\nThus can my love excuse the slow offence,\r\nOf my dull bearer, when from thee I speed,\r\nFrom where thou art, why should I haste me thence?\r\nTill I return of posting is no need.\r\nO what excuse will my poor beast then find,\r\nWhen swift extremity can seem but slow?\r\nThen should I spur though mounted on the wind,\r\nIn winged speed no motion shall I know,\r\nThen can no horse with my desire keep pace,\r\nTherefore desire (of perfect’st love being made)\r\nShall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race,\r\nBut love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade:\r\n  Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,\r\n  Towards thee I’ll run, and give him leave to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    52\r\n\r\nSo am I as the rich whose blessed key,\r\nCan bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,\r\nThe which he will not every hour survey,\r\nFor blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.\r\nTherefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,\r\nSince seldom coming in that long year set,\r\nLike stones of worth they thinly placed are,\r\nOr captain jewels in the carcanet.\r\nSo is the time that keeps you as my chest\r\nOr as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,\r\nTo make some special instant special-blest,\r\nBy new unfolding his imprisoned pride.\r\n  Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,\r\n  Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    53\r\n\r\nWhat is your substance, whereof are you made,\r\nThat millions of strange shadows on you tend?\r\nSince every one, hath every one, one shade,\r\nAnd you but one, can every shadow lend:\r\nDescribe Adonis and the counterfeit,\r\nIs poorly imitated after you,\r\nOn Helen’s cheek all art of beauty set,\r\nAnd you in Grecian tires are painted new:\r\nSpeak of the spring, and foison of the year,\r\nThe one doth shadow of your beauty show,\r\nThe other as your bounty doth appear,\r\nAnd you in every blessed shape we know.\r\n  In all external grace you have some part,\r\n  But you like none, none you for constant heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    54\r\n\r\nO how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,\r\nBy that sweet ornament which truth doth give!\r\nThe rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem\r\nFor that sweet odour, which doth in it live:\r\nThe canker blooms have full as deep a dye,\r\nAs the perfumed tincture of the roses,\r\nHang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,\r\nWhen summer’s breath their masked buds discloses:\r\nBut for their virtue only is their show,\r\nThey live unwooed, and unrespected fade,\r\nDie to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,\r\nOf their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:\r\n  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,\r\n  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    55\r\n\r\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments\r\nOf princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,\r\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\r\nThan unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.\r\nWhen wasteful war shall statues overturn,\r\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\r\nNor Mars his sword, nor war’s quick fire shall burn:\r\nThe living record of your memory.\r\n’Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity\r\nShall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,\r\nEven in the eyes of all posterity\r\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom.\r\n  So till the judgment that yourself arise,\r\n  You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    56\r\n\r\nSweet love renew thy force, be it not said\r\nThy edge should blunter be than appetite,\r\nWhich but to-day by feeding is allayed,\r\nTo-morrow sharpened in his former might.\r\nSo love be thou, although to-day thou fill\r\nThy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,\r\nTo-morrow see again, and do not kill\r\nThe spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness:\r\nLet this sad interim like the ocean be\r\nWhich parts the shore, where two contracted new,\r\nCome daily to the banks, that when they see:\r\nReturn of love, more blest may be the view.\r\n  Or call it winter, which being full of care,\r\n  Makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    57\r\n\r\nBeing your slave what should I do but tend,\r\nUpon the hours, and times of your desire?\r\nI have no precious time at all to spend;\r\nNor services to do till you require.\r\nNor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,\r\nWhilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you,\r\nNor think the bitterness of absence sour,\r\nWhen you have bid your servant once adieu.\r\nNor dare I question with my jealous thought,\r\nWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,\r\nBut like a sad slave stay and think of nought\r\nSave where you are, how happy you make those.\r\n  So true a fool is love, that in your will,\r\n  (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    58\r\n\r\nThat god forbid, that made me first your slave,\r\nI should in thought control your times of pleasure,\r\nOr at your hand th’ account of hours to crave,\r\nBeing your vassal bound to stay your leisure.\r\nO let me suffer (being at your beck)\r\nTh’ imprisoned absence of your liberty,\r\nAnd patience tame to sufferance bide each check,\r\nWithout accusing you of injury.\r\nBe where you list, your charter is so strong,\r\nThat you yourself may privilage your time\r\nTo what you will, to you it doth belong,\r\nYourself to pardon of self-doing crime.\r\n  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,\r\n  Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    59\r\n\r\nIf there be nothing new, but that which is,\r\nHath been before, how are our brains beguiled,\r\nWhich labouring for invention bear amiss\r\nThe second burthen of a former child!\r\nO that record could with a backward look,\r\nEven of five hundred courses of the sun,\r\nShow me your image in some antique book,\r\nSince mind at first in character was done.\r\nThat I might see what the old world could say,\r\nTo this composed wonder of your frame,\r\nWhether we are mended, or whether better they,\r\nOr whether revolution be the same.\r\n  O sure I am the wits of former days,\r\n  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    60\r\n\r\nLike as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,\r\nSo do our minutes hasten to their end,\r\nEach changing place with that which goes before,\r\nIn sequent toil all forwards do contend.\r\nNativity once in the main of light,\r\nCrawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,\r\nCrooked eclipses ’gainst his glory fight,\r\nAnd Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.\r\nTime doth transfix the flourish set on youth,\r\nAnd delves the parallels in beauty’s brow,\r\nFeeds on the rarities of nature’s truth,\r\nAnd nothing stands but for his scythe to mow.\r\n  And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand\r\n  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    61\r\n\r\nIs it thy will, thy image should keep open\r\nMy heavy eyelids to the weary night?\r\nDost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,\r\nWhile shadows like to thee do mock my sight?\r\nIs it thy spirit that thou send’st from thee\r\nSo far from home into my deeds to pry,\r\nTo find out shames and idle hours in me,\r\nThe scope and tenure of thy jealousy?\r\nO no, thy love though much, is not so great,\r\nIt is my love that keeps mine eye awake,\r\nMine own true love that doth my rest defeat,\r\nTo play the watchman ever for thy sake.\r\n  For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,\r\n  From me far off, with others all too near.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    62\r\n\r\nSin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,\r\nAnd all my soul, and all my every part;\r\nAnd for this sin there is no remedy,\r\nIt is so grounded inward in my heart.\r\nMethinks no face so gracious is as mine,\r\nNo shape so true, no truth of such account,\r\nAnd for my self mine own worth do define,\r\nAs I all other in all worths surmount.\r\nBut when my glass shows me my self indeed\r\nbeated and chopt with tanned antiquity,\r\nMine own self-love quite contrary I read:\r\nSelf, so self-loving were iniquity.\r\n  ’Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,\r\n  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    63\r\n\r\nAgainst my love shall be as I am now\r\nWith Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’erworn,\r\nWhen hours have drained his blood and filled his brow\r\nWith lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn\r\nHath travelled on to age’s steepy night,\r\nAnd all those beauties whereof now he’s king\r\nAre vanishing, or vanished out of sight,\r\nStealing away the treasure of his spring:\r\nFor such a time do I now fortify\r\nAgainst confounding age’s cruel knife,\r\nThat he shall never cut from memory\r\nMy sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life.\r\n  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,\r\n  And they shall live, and he in them still green.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    64\r\n\r\nWhen I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced\r\nThe rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,\r\nWhen sometime lofty towers I see down-rased,\r\nAnd brass eternal slave to mortal rage.\r\nWhen I have seen the hungry ocean gain\r\nAdvantage on the kingdom of the shore,\r\nAnd the firm soil win of the watery main,\r\nIncreasing store with loss, and loss with store.\r\nWhen I have seen such interchange of State,\r\nOr state it self confounded, to decay,\r\nRuin hath taught me thus to ruminate:\r\nThat Time will come and take my love away.\r\n  This thought is as a death which cannot choose\r\n  But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    65\r\n\r\nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\r\nBut sad mortality o’ersways their power,\r\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,\r\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\r\nO how shall summer’s honey breath hold out,\r\nAgainst the wrackful siege of batt’ring days,\r\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\r\nNor gates of steel so strong but time decays?\r\nO fearful meditation, where alack,\r\nShall Time’s best jewel from Time’s chest lie hid?\r\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,\r\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\r\n  O none, unless this miracle have might,\r\n  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    66\r\n\r\nTired with all these, for restful death I cry:\r\nAs to behold desert a beggar born,\r\nAnd needy nothing trimmed in jollity,\r\nAnd purest faith unhappily forsworn,\r\nAnd gilded honour shamefully misplaced,\r\nAnd maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,\r\nAnd right perfection wrongfully disgraced,\r\nAnd strength by limping sway disabled\r\nAnd art made tongue-tied by authority,\r\nAnd folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,\r\nAnd simple truth miscalled simplicity,\r\nAnd captive good attending captain ill.\r\n  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,\r\n  Save that to die, I leave my love alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    67\r\n\r\nAh wherefore with infection should he live,\r\nAnd with his presence grace impiety,\r\nThat sin by him advantage should achieve,\r\nAnd lace it self with his society?\r\nWhy should false painting imitate his cheek,\r\nAnd steal dead seeming of his living hue?\r\nWhy should poor beauty indirectly seek,\r\nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true?\r\nWhy should he live, now nature bankrupt is,\r\nBeggared of blood to blush through lively veins,\r\nFor she hath no exchequer now but his,\r\nAnd proud of many, lives upon his gains?\r\n  O him she stores, to show what wealth she had,\r\n  In days long since, before these last so bad.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    68\r\n\r\nThus is his cheek the map of days outworn,\r\nWhen beauty lived and died as flowers do now,\r\nBefore these bastard signs of fair were born,\r\nOr durst inhabit on a living brow:\r\nBefore the golden tresses of the dead,\r\nThe right of sepulchres, were shorn away,\r\nTo live a second life on second head,\r\nEre beauty’s dead fleece made another gay:\r\nIn him those holy antique hours are seen,\r\nWithout all ornament, it self and true,\r\nMaking no summer of another’s green,\r\nRobbing no old to dress his beauty new,\r\n  And him as for a map doth Nature store,\r\n  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    69\r\n\r\nThose parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view,\r\nWant nothing that the thought of hearts can mend:\r\nAll tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,\r\nUttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.\r\nThy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,\r\nBut those same tongues that give thee so thine own,\r\nIn other accents do this praise confound\r\nBy seeing farther than the eye hath shown.\r\nThey look into the beauty of thy mind,\r\nAnd that in guess they measure by thy deeds,\r\nThen churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)\r\nTo thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:\r\n  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,\r\n  The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    70\r\n\r\nThat thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,\r\nFor slander’s mark was ever yet the fair,\r\nThe ornament of beauty is suspect,\r\nA crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.\r\nSo thou be good, slander doth but approve,\r\nThy worth the greater being wooed of time,\r\nFor canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,\r\nAnd thou present’st a pure unstained prime.\r\nThou hast passed by the ambush of young days,\r\nEither not assailed, or victor being charged,\r\nYet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,\r\nTo tie up envy, evermore enlarged,\r\n  If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,\r\n  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    71\r\n\r\nNo longer mourn for me when I am dead,\r\nThan you shall hear the surly sullen bell\r\nGive warning to the world that I am fled\r\nFrom this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:\r\nNay if you read this line, remember not,\r\nThe hand that writ it, for I love you so,\r\nThat I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,\r\nIf thinking on me then should make you woe.\r\nO if, I say, you look upon this verse,\r\nWhen I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,\r\nDo not so much as my poor name rehearse;\r\nBut let your love even with my life decay.\r\n  Lest the wise world should look into your moan,\r\n  And mock you with me after I am gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    72\r\n\r\nO lest the world should task you to recite,\r\nWhat merit lived in me that you should love\r\nAfter my death, dear love, forget me quite,\r\nFor you in me can nothing worthy prove.\r\nUnless you would devise some virtuous lie,\r\nTo do more for me than mine own desert,\r\nAnd hang more praise upon deceased I,\r\nThan niggard truth would willingly impart:\r\nO lest your true love may seem false in this,\r\nThat you for love speak well of me untrue,\r\nMy name be buried where my body is,\r\nAnd live no more to shame nor me, nor you.\r\n  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,\r\n  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    73\r\n\r\nThat time of year thou mayst in me behold,\r\nWhen yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang\r\nUpon those boughs which shake against the cold,\r\nBare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.\r\nIn me thou

		    "text": "Little Women, by Louisa M. Alcott\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n                           PLAYING PILGRIMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\" grumbled Jo, lying\r\non the rug.\r\n\r\n\"It's so dreadful to be poor!\" sighed Meg, looking down at her old\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things,\r\nand other girls nothing at all,\" added little Amy, with an injured\r\nsniff.\r\n\r\n\"We've got father and mother and each other,\" said Beth contentedly,\r\nfrom her corner.\r\n\r\nThe four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the\r\ncheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,--\r\n\r\n\"We haven't got father, and shall not have him for a long time.\" She\r\ndidn't say \"perhaps never,\" but each silently added it, thinking of\r\nfather far away, where the fighting was.\r\n\r\nNobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,--\r\n\r\n\"You know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this\r\nChristmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for every one; and\r\nshe thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are\r\nsuffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little\r\nsacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't;\" and Meg\r\nshook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've\r\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\r\nthat. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want\r\nto buy Undine and Sintram for myself; I've wanted it _so_ long,\" said\r\nJo, who was a bookworm.\r\n\r\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\r\nwhich no one heard but the hearth-brush and kettle-holder.\r\n\r\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing-pencils; I really need them,\"\r\nsaid Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\r\ngive up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun;\r\nI'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels\r\nof her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\r\n\r\n\"I know _I_ do,--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when\r\nI'm longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\r\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\r\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\r\nfly out of the window or cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\r\ntidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross; and my hands get\r\nso stiff, I can't practise well at all;\" and Beth looked at her rough\r\nhands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy; \"for you don't\r\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't\r\nknow your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if\r\nhe isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean _libel_, I'd say so, and not talk about _labels_, as if\r\npapa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be _statirical_ about it. It's\r\nproper to use good words, and improve your _vocabilary_,\" returned Amy,\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money\r\npapa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! how happy and good we'd be,\r\nif we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\r\n\r\n\"You said the other day, you thought we were a deal happier than the\r\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\r\nspite of their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are; for, though we do have to work,\r\nwe make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\r\nthe long figure stretched on the rug. Jo immediately sat up, put her\r\nhands in her pockets, and began to whistle.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why I do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I detest rude, unlady-like girls!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Birds in their little nests agree,'\" sang Beth, the peace-maker, with\r\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\r\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\r\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\r\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much\r\nwhen you were a little girl; but now you are so tall, and turn up your\r\nhair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not! and if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\r\ntails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down\r\na chestnut mane. \"I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss\r\nMarch, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China-aster! It's bad\r\nenough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boys' games and work and\r\nmanners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy; and it's\r\nworse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with papa, and I can\r\nonly stay at home and knit, like a poky old woman!\" And Jo shook the\r\nblue army-sock till the needles rattled like castanets, and her ball\r\nbounded across the room.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Jo! It's too bad, but it can't be helped; so you must try to be\r\ncontented with making your name boyish, and playing brother to us\r\ngirls,\" said Beth, stroking the rough head at her knee with a hand that\r\nall the dish-washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in\r\nits touch.\r\n\r\n\"As for you, Amy,\" continued Meg, \"you are altogether too particular and\r\nprim. Your airs are funny now; but you'll grow up an affected little\r\ngoose, if you don't take care. I like your nice manners and refined ways\r\nof speaking, when you don't try to be elegant; but your absurd words are\r\nas bad as Jo's slang.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Jo is a tom-boy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?\" asked Beth,\r\nready to share the lecture.\r\n\r\n\"You're a dear, and nothing else,\" answered Meg warmly; and no one\r\ncontradicted her, for the \"Mouse\" was the pet of the family.\r\n\r\nAs young readers like to know \"how people look,\" we will take this\r\nmoment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat\r\nknitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly\r\nwithout, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable\r\nold room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain; for\r\na good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses,\r\nchrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a\r\npleasant atmosphere of home-peace pervaded it.\r\n\r\nMargaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being\r\nplump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft, brown hair, a sweet\r\nmouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old\r\nJo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt; for she\r\nnever seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very\r\nmuch in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,\r\ngray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,\r\nfunny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty; but it\r\nwas usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders\r\nhad Jo, big hands and feet, a fly-away look to her clothes, and the\r\nuncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a\r\nwoman, and didn't like it. Elizabeth--or Beth, as every one called\r\nher--was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy\r\nmanner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression, which was seldom\r\ndisturbed. Her father called her \"Little Tranquillity,\" and the name\r\nsuited her excellently; for she seemed to live in a happy world of her\r\nown, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy,\r\nthough the youngest, was a most important person,--in her own opinion at\r\nleast. A regular snow-maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair, curling\r\non her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a\r\nyoung lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four\r\nsisters were we will leave to be found out.\r\n\r\nThe clock struck six; and, having swept up the hearth, Beth put a pair\r\nof slippers down to warm. Somehow the sight of the old shoes had a good\r\neffect upon the girls; for mother was coming, and every one brightened\r\nto welcome her. Meg stopped lecturing, and lighted the lamp, Amy got out\r\nof the easy-chair without being asked, and Jo forgot how tired she was\r\nas she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm]\r\n\r\n\"They are quite worn out; Marmee must have a new pair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar,\" said Beth.\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall!\" cried Amy.\r\n\r\n\"I'm the oldest,\" began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided--\r\n\r\n\"I'm the man of the family now papa is away, and _I_ shall provide the\r\nslippers, for he told me to take special care of mother while he was\r\ngone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what we'll do,\" said Beth; \"let's each get her something\r\nfor Christmas, and not get anything for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's like you, dear! What will we get?\" exclaimed Jo.\r\n\r\nEvery one thought soberly for a minute; then Meg announced, as if the\r\nidea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, \"I shall give\r\nher a nice pair of gloves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Army shoes, best to be had,\" cried Jo.\r\n\r\n\"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,\" said Beth.\r\n\r\n\"I'll get a little bottle of cologne; she likes it, and it won't cost\r\nmuch, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils,\" added Amy.\r\n\r\n\"How will we give the things?\" asked Meg.\r\n\r\n\"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open the bundles.\r\nDon't you remember how we used to do on our birthdays?\" answered Jo.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: I used to be so frightened when it was my\r\n                     turn to sit in the big chair]\r\n\r\n\"I used to be _so_ frightened when it was my turn to sit in the big\r\nchair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the\r\npresents, with a kiss. I liked the things and the kisses, but it was\r\ndreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened the bundles,\" said\r\nBeth, who was toasting her face and the bread for tea, at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and then surprise\r\nher. We must go shopping to-morrow afternoon, Meg; there is so much to\r\ndo about the play for Christmas night,\" said Jo, marching up and down,\r\nwith her hands behind her back and her nose in the air.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to act any more after this time; I'm getting too old for\r\nsuch things,\" observed Meg, who was as much a child as ever about\r\n\"dressing-up\" frolics.\r\n\r\n\"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a white gown\r\nwith your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry. You are the best\r\nactress we've got, and there'll be an end of everything if you quit the\r\nboards,\" said Jo. \"We ought to rehearse to-night. Come here, Amy, and do\r\nthe fainting scene, for you are as stiff as a poker in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help it; I never saw any one faint, and I don't choose to make\r\nmyself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do. If I can go down\r\neasily, I'll drop; if I can't, I shall fall into a chair and be\r\ngraceful; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with a pistol,\" returned\r\nAmy, who was not gifted with dramatic power, but was chosen because she\r\nwas small enough to be borne out shrieking by the villain of the piece.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: Do it this way, clasp your hands so]\r\n\r\n\"Do it this way; clasp your hands so, and stagger across the room,\r\ncrying frantically, 'Roderigo! save me! save me!'\" and away went Jo,\r\nwith a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.\r\n\r\nAmy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her, and jerked\r\nherself along as if she went by machinery; and her \"Ow!\" was more\r\nsuggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and anguish. Jo gave\r\na despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright, while Beth let her bread\r\nburn as she watched the fun, with interest.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use! Do the best you can when the time comes, and if the\r\naudience laugh, don't blame me. Come on, Meg.\"\r\n\r\nThen things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in a speech of\r\ntwo pages without a single break; Hagar, the witch, chanted an awful\r\nincantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect;\r\nRoderigo rent his chains asunder manfully, and Hugo died in agonies of\r\nremorse and arsenic, with a wild \"Ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the best we've had yet,\" said Meg, as the dead villain sat up and\r\nrubbed his elbows.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things, Jo. You're\r\na regular Shakespeare!\" exclaimed Beth, who firmly believed that her\r\nsisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all things.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" replied Jo modestly. \"I do think 'The Witch's Curse, an\r\nOperatic Tragedy,' is rather a nice thing; but I'd like to try Macbeth,\r\nif we only had a trap-door for Banquo. I always wanted to do the killing\r\npart. 'Is that a dagger that I see before me?'\" muttered Jo, rolling her\r\neyes and clutching at the air, as she had seen a famous tragedian do.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's the toasting fork, with mother's shoe on it instead of the\r\nbread. Beth's stage-struck!\" cried Meg, and the rehearsal ended in a\r\ngeneral burst of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to find you so merry, my girls,\" said a cheery voice at the door,\r\nand actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady, with a\r\n\"can-I-help-you\" look about her which was truly delightful. She was not\r\nelegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the girls thought the\r\ngray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most splendid mother in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\"Well, dearies, how have you got on to-day? There was so much to do,\r\ngetting the boxes ready to go to-morrow, that I didn't come home to\r\ndinner. Has any one called, Beth? How is your cold, Meg? Jo, you look\r\ntired to death. Come and kiss me, baby.\"\r\n\r\nWhile making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet things off,\r\nher warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy-chair, drew Amy to\r\nher lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. The girls\r\nflew about, trying to make things comfortable, each in her own way. Meg\r\narranged the tea-table; Jo brought wood and set chairs, dropping,\r\noverturning, and clattering everything she touched; Beth trotted to and\r\nfro between parlor and kitchen, quiet and busy; while Amy gave\r\ndirections to every one, as she sat with her hands folded.\r\n\r\nAs they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a particularly\r\nhappy face, \"I've got a treat for you after supper.\"\r\n\r\nA quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. Beth clapped\r\nher hands, regardless of the biscuit she held, and Jo tossed up her\r\nnapkin, crying, \"A letter! a letter! Three cheers for father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a nice long letter. He is well, and thinks he shall get through\r\nthe cold season better than we feared. He sends all sorts of loving\r\nwishes for Christmas, and an especial message to you girls,\" said Mrs.\r\nMarch, patting her pocket as if she had got a treasure there.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry and get done! Don't stop to quirk your little finger, and simper\r\nover your plate, Amy,\" cried Jo, choking in her tea, and dropping her\r\nbread, butter side down, on the carpet, in her haste to get at the\r\ntreat.\r\n\r\nBeth ate no more, but crept away, to sit in her shadowy corner and brood\r\nover the delight to come, till the others were ready.\r\n\r\n\"I think it was so splendid in father to go as a chaplain when he was\r\ntoo old to be drafted, and not strong enough for a soldier,\" said Meg\r\nwarmly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a _vivan_--what's its name? or a\r\nnurse, so I could be near him and help him,\" exclaimed Jo, with a groan.\r\n\r\n\"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat all sorts of\r\nbad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,\" sighed Amy.\r\n\r\n\"When will he come home, Marmee?\" asked Beth, with a little quiver in\r\nher voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick. He will stay and do his\r\nwork faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask for him back a\r\nminute sooner than he can be spared. Now come and hear the letter.\"\r\n\r\nThey all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with Beth at her\r\nfeet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and Jo leaning on\r\nthe back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter\r\nshould happen to be touching.\r\n\r\nVery few letters were written in those hard times that were not\r\ntouching, especially those which fathers sent home. In this one little\r\nwas said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the\r\nhomesickness conquered; it was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of\r\nlively descriptions of camp life, marches, and military news; and only\r\nat the end did the writer's heart overflow with fatherly love and\r\nlonging for the little girls at home.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: It was a cheerful, hopeful letter]\r\n\r\n\"Give them all my dear love and a kiss. Tell them I think of them by\r\nday, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort in their affection\r\nat all times. A year seems very long to wait before I see them, but\r\nremind them that while we wait we may all work, so that these hard days\r\nneed not be wasted. I know they will remember all I said to them, that\r\nthey will be loving children to you, will do their duty faithfully,\r\nfight their bosom enemies bravely, and conquer themselves so\r\nbeautifully, that when I come back to them I may be fonder and prouder\r\nthan ever of my little women.\"\r\n\r\nEverybody sniffed when they came to that part; Jo wasn't ashamed of the\r\ngreat tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and Amy never minded\r\nthe rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother's shoulder\r\nand sobbed out, \"I _am_ a selfish girl! but I'll truly try to be better,\r\nso he mayn't be disappointed in me by and by.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all will!\" cried Meg. \"I think too much of my looks, and hate to\r\nwork, but won't any more, if I can help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be\r\nrough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere\r\nelse,\" said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper at home was a much\r\nharder task than facing a rebel or two down South.\r\n\r\nBeth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army-sock, and\r\nbegan to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing the duty that\r\nlay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet little soul to be all\r\nthat father hoped to find her when the year brought round the happy\r\ncoming home.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: How you used to play Pilgrim's Progress]\r\n\r\nMrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her\r\ncheery voice, \"Do you remember how you used to play Pilgrim's Progress\r\nwhen you were little things? Nothing delighted you more than to have me\r\ntie my piece-bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks\r\nand rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the\r\ncellar, which was the City of Destruction, up, up, to the house-top,\r\nwhere you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a\r\nCelestial City.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting Apollyon, and\r\npassing through the Valley where the hobgoblins were!\" said Jo.\r\n\r\n\"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled down stairs,\"\r\nsaid Meg.\r\n\r\n\"My favorite part was when we came out on the flat roof where our\r\nflowers and arbors and pretty things were, and all stood and sung for\r\njoy up there in the sunshine,\" said Beth, smiling, as if that pleasant\r\nmoment had come back to her.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of the cellar\r\nand the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk we had up at the\r\ntop. If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd rather like to play it\r\nover again,\" said Amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things\r\nat the mature age of twelve.\r\n\r\n\"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are\r\nplaying all the time in one way or another. Our burdens are here, our\r\nroad is before us, and the longing for goodness and happiness is the\r\nguide that leads us through many troubles and mistakes to the peace\r\nwhich is a true Celestial City. Now, my little pilgrims, suppose you\r\nbegin again, not in play, but in earnest, and see how far on you can get\r\nbefore father comes home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, mother? Where are our bundles?\" asked Amy, who was a very\r\nliteral young lady.\r\n\r\n\"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth; I rather\r\nthink she hasn't got any,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have; mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls with nice\r\npianos, and being afraid of people.\"\r\n\r\nBeth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to laugh; but\r\nnobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very much.\r\n\r\n\"Let us do it,\" said Meg thoughtfully. \"It is only another name for\r\ntrying to be good, and the story may help us; for though we do want to\r\nbe good, it's hard work, and we forget, and don't do our best.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were in the Slough of Despond to-night, and mother came and pulled\r\nus out as Help did in the book. We ought to have our roll of directions,\r\nlike Christian. What shall we do about that?\" asked Jo, delighted with\r\nthe fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\"Look under your pillows, Christmas morning, and you will find your\r\nguide-book,\" replied Mrs. March.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the table; then\r\nout came the four little work-baskets, and the needles flew as the girls\r\nmade sheets for Aunt March. It was uninteresting sewing, but to-night no\r\none grumbled. They adopted Jo's plan of dividing the long seams into\r\nfour parts, and calling the quarters Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,\r\nand in that way got on capitally, especially when they talked about the\r\ndifferent countries as they stitched their way through them.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: No one but Beth could get much music out of the old\r\n                                 piano]\r\n\r\nAt nine they stopped work, and sung, as usual, before they went to bed.\r\nNo one but Beth could get much music out of the old piano; but she had a\r\nway of softly touching the yellow keys, and making a pleasant\r\naccompaniment to the simple songs they sung. Meg had a voice like a\r\nflute, and she and her mother led the little choir. Amy chirped like a\r\ncricket, and Jo wandered through the airs at her own sweet will, always\r\ncoming out at the wrong place with a croak or a quaver that spoilt the\r\nmost pensive tune. They had always done this from the time they could\r\nlisp\r\n\r\n        \"Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,\"\r\n\r\nand it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born singer.\r\nThe first sound in the morning was her voice, as she went about the\r\nhouse singing like a lark; and the last sound at night was the same\r\ncheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for that familiar\r\nlullaby.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: At nine they stopped work and sung as usual]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: A Merry Christmas]\r\n\r\n                                   II.\r\n\r\n                           A MERRY CHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning. No\r\nstockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much\r\ndisappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because\r\nit was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother's\r\npromise, and, slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little\r\ncrimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful\r\nold story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true\r\nguide-book for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a\r\n\"Merry Christmas,\" and bade her see what was under her pillow. A\r\ngreen-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few\r\nwords written by their mother, which made their one present very\r\nprecious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find\r\ntheir little books also,--one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat\r\nlooking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the\r\ncoming day.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature,\r\nwhich unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her\r\nvery tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.\r\n\r\n\"Girls,\" said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to\r\nthe two little night-capped ones in the room beyond, \"mother wants us to\r\nread and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used\r\nto be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war\r\ntrouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you\r\nplease; but _I_ shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little\r\nevery morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help\r\nme through the day.\"\r\n\r\nThen she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm round\r\nher, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression\r\nso seldom seen on her restless face.\r\n\r\n\"How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let's do as they do. I'll help you with the\r\nhard words, and they'll explain things if we don't understand,\"\r\nwhispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters'\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad mine is blue,\" said Amy; and then the rooms were very still\r\nwhile the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to\r\ntouch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Where is mother?\" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for\r\ntheir gifts, half an hour later.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin', and your ma went\r\nstraight off to see what was needed. There never _was_ such a woman for\r\ngivin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',\" replied Hannah, who\r\nhad lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them\r\nall more as a friend than a servant.\r\n\r\n\"She will be back soon, I think; so fry your cakes, and have everything\r\nready,\" said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a\r\nbasket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time.\r\n\"Why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?\" she added, as the little flask\r\ndid not appear.\r\n\r\n\"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on\r\nit, or some such notion,\" replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the\r\nfirst stiffness off the new army-slippers.\r\n\r\n\"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they? Hannah washed and ironed\r\nthem for me, and I marked them all myself,\" said Beth, looking proudly\r\nat the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.\r\n\r\n\"Bless the child! she's gone and put 'Mother' on them instead of 'M.\r\nMarch.' How funny!\" cried Jo, taking up one.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg's\r\ninitials are 'M. M.,' and I don't want any one to use these but Marmee,\"\r\nsaid Beth, looking troubled.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea,--quite sensible, too, for\r\nno one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,\" said\r\nMeg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.\r\n\r\n\"There's mother. Hide the basket, quick!\" cried Jo, as a door slammed,\r\nand steps sounded in the hall.\r\n\r\nAmy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters\r\nall waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?\" asked Meg,\r\nsurprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh at me, Jo! I didn't mean any one should know till the time\r\ncame. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave\r\n_all_ my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not to be selfish any\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap\r\none; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget\r\nherself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo pronounced her \"a\r\ntrump,\" while Beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to\r\nornament the stately bottle.\r\n\r\n\"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about\r\nbeing good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed it the\r\nminute I was up: and I'm _so_ glad, for mine is the handsomest now.\"\r\n\r\nAnother bang of the street-door sent the basket under the sofa, and the\r\ngirls to the table, eager for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, Marmee! Many of them! Thank you for our books; we read\r\nsome, and mean to every day,\" they cried, in chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, little daughters! I'm glad you began at once, and hope\r\nyou will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far\r\naway from here lies a poor woman with a little new-born baby. Six\r\nchildren are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have\r\nno fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to\r\ntell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give\r\nthem your breakfast as a Christmas present?\"\r\n\r\nThey were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a\r\nminute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously,--\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad you came before we began!\"\r\n\r\n\"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?\" asked\r\nBeth, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ shall take the cream and the muffins,\" added Amy, heroically giving\r\nup the articles she most liked.\r\n\r\nMeg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread into one\r\nbig plate.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd do it,\" said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. \"You\r\nshall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread and\r\nmilk for breakfast, and make it up at dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\nThey were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately it was\r\nearly, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and\r\nno one laughed at the queer party.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: The procession set out]\r\n\r\nA poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire,\r\nragged bed-clothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale,\r\nhungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm.\r\n\r\nHow the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in!\r\n\r\n\"Ach, mein Gott! it is good angels come to us!\" said the poor woman,\r\ncrying for joy.\r\n\r\n\"Funny angels in hoods and mittens,\" said Jo, and set them laughing.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work\r\nthere. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the\r\nbroken panes with old hats and her own cloak. Mrs. March gave the mother\r\ntea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she\r\ndressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The\r\ngirls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and\r\nfed them like so many hungry birds,--laughing, talking, and trying to\r\nunderstand the funny broken English.\r\n\r\n\"Das ist gut!\" \"Die Engel-kinder!\" cried the poor things, as they ate,\r\nand warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.\r\n\r\nThe girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it\r\nvery agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered a \"Sancho\" ever\r\nsince she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn't\r\nget any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think\r\nthere were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry\r\nlittle girls who gave away their breakfasts and contented themselves\r\nwith bread and milk on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\n\"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,\" said\r\nMeg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs\r\ncollecting clothes for the poor Hummels.\r\n\r\nNot a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in\r\nthe few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white\r\nchrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave\r\nquite an elegant air to the table.\r\n\r\n\"She's coming! Strike up, Beth! Open the door, Amy! Three cheers for\r\nMarmee!\" cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to\r\nthe seat of honor.\r\n\r\nBeth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted\r\nescort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched;\r\nand smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents, and read the\r\nlittle notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once, a new\r\nhandkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy's\r\ncologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were\r\npronounced a \"perfect fit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the\r\nsimple, loving fashion which makes these home-festivals so pleasant at\r\nthe time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of\r\nthe day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being\r\nstill too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to\r\nafford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their\r\nwits to work, and--necessity being the mother of invention,--made\r\nwhatever they needed. Very clever were some of their\r\nproductions,--pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned\r\nbutter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton,\r\nglittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered\r\nwith the same useful diamond-shaped bits, left in sheets when the lids\r\nof tin preserve-pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being\r\nturned topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent\r\nrevels.\r\n\r\nNo gentlemen were admitted; so Jo played male parts to her heart's\r\ncontent, and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet-leather boots\r\ngiven her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots,\r\nan old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some\r\npicture, were Jo's chief treasures, and appeared on all occasions. The\r\nsmallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors\r\nto take several parts apiece; and they certainly deserved some credit\r\nfor the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts,\r\nwhisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.\r\nIt was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and\r\nemployed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or\r\nspent in less profitable society.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas night, a dozen girls piled on to the bed which was the\r\ndress-circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a\r\nmost flattering state of expectancy. There was a good deal of rustling\r\nand whispering behind the curtain, a trifle of lamp-smoke, and an\r\noccasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to get hysterical in the\r\nexcitement of the moment. Presently a bell sounded, the curtains flew\r\napart, and the Operatic Tragedy began.\r\n\r\n\"A gloomy wood,\" according to the one play-bill, was represented by a\r\nfew shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the\r\ndistance. This cave was made with a clothes-horse for a roof, bureaus\r\nfor walls; and in it was a small furnace in full blast, with a black pot\r\non it, and an old witch bending over it. The stage was dark, and the\r\nglow of the furnace had a fine effect, especially as real steam issued\r\nfrom the kettle when the witch took off the cover. A moment was allowed\r\nfor the first thrill to subside; then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with\r\na clanking sword at his side, a slouched hat, black beard, mysterious\r\ncloak, and the boots. After pacing to and fro in much agitation, he\r\nstruck his forehead, and burst out in a wild strain, singing of his\r\nhatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara, and his pleasing resolution to\r\nkill the one and win the other. The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an\r\noccasional shout when his feelings overcame him, were very impressive,\r\nand the audience applauded the moment he paused for breath. Bowing with\r\nthe air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern, and\r\nordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding \"What ho, minion! I need\r\nthee!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Out came Meg with gray horse-hair hanging about her face]\r\n\r\nOut came Meg, with gray horse-hair hanging about her face, a red and\r\nblack robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. Hugo demanded\r\na potion to make Zara adore him, and one to destroy Roderigo. Hagar, in\r\na fine dramatic melody, promised both, and proceeded to call up the\r\nspirit who would bring the love philter:--\r\n\r\n        \"Hither, hither, from thy home,\r\n         Airy sprite, I bid thee come!\r\n         Born of roses, fed on dew,\r\n         Charms and potions canst thou brew?\r\n         Bring me here, with elfin speed,\r\n         The fragrant philter which I need;\r\n         Make it sweet and swift and strong,\r\n         Spirit, answer now my song!\"\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: A little figure "

		    "text": "Middlemarch, by George Eliot\r\n\r\nPRELUDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious\r\nmixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt,\r\nat least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with\r\nsome gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one\r\nmorning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek\r\nmartyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged\r\nAvila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human\r\nhearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met\r\nthem in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great\r\nresolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s\r\npassionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed\r\nromances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to\r\nher? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within,\r\nsoared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would\r\nnever justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the\r\nrapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the\r\nreform of a religious order.\r\n\r\nThat Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not\r\nthe last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for\r\nthemselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of\r\nfar-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of\r\na certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of\r\nopportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and\r\nsank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance\r\nthey tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but\r\nafter all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and\r\nformlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent\r\nsocial faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge\r\nfor the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague\r\nideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was\r\ndisapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.\r\n\r\nSome have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient\r\nindefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures\r\nof women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as\r\nthe ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might\r\nbe treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness\r\nremains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one\r\nwould imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite\r\nlove-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared\r\nuneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the\r\nliving stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and\r\nthere is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving\r\nheart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are\r\ndispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some\r\nlong-recognizable deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\nMISS BROOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSince I can do no good because a woman,\r\nReach constantly at something that is near it.\r\n                    —_The Maid’s Tragedy:_ BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into\r\nrelief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she\r\ncould wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the\r\nBlessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as\r\nher stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain\r\ngarments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the\r\nimpressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our\r\nelder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper. She was usually\r\nspoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her\r\nsister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely\r\nmore trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress\r\ndiffered from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its\r\narrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed\r\nconditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being\r\nladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not\r\nexactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired\r\nbackward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring\r\nor parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a\r\nclergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan\r\ngentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and\r\nmanaged to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a\r\nrespectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet\r\ncountry-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a\r\nparlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s\r\ndaughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made\r\nshow in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was\r\nrequired for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have\r\nbeen enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious\r\nfeeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have\r\ndetermined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s\r\nsentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to\r\naccept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea\r\nknew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;\r\nand to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,\r\nmade the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for\r\nBedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life\r\ninvolving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and\r\nartificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned\r\nby its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might\r\nfrankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;\r\nshe was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing\r\nwhatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,\r\nto make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a\r\nquarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the\r\ncharacter of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and\r\nhinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,\r\nvanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of\r\nthe sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since\r\nthey were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans\r\nat once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and\r\nafterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and\r\nguardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their\r\norphaned condition.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with\r\ntheir uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous\r\nopinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,\r\nand was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too\r\nrambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to\r\npredict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with\r\nbenevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as\r\npossible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite\r\nminds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax\r\nabout all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,\r\nconcerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in\r\nabeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and\r\nvirtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his\r\nway of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the\r\nmore for the time when she would be of age and have some command of\r\nmoney for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not\r\nonly had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but\r\nif Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s\r\nestate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which\r\nseemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late\r\nconduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and\r\nof that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities\r\nof genteel life.\r\n\r\nAnd how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such\r\nprospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her\r\ninsistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a\r\nwary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead\r\nher at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and\r\nfortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick\r\nlaborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the\r\ntime of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,\r\nand of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife\r\nmight awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the\r\napplication of her income which would interfere with political economy\r\nand the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice\r\nbefore he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to\r\nhave weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic\r\nlife was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their\r\nneighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know\r\nand avoid them.\r\n\r\nThe rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,\r\nwas generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and\r\ninnocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her\r\nreligion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,\r\nthe innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much\r\nsubtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of\r\nblazonry or clock-face for it.\r\n\r\nYet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by\r\nthis alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably\r\nreconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on\r\nhorseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the\r\ncountry, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she\r\nlooked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she\r\nallowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she\r\nenjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to\r\nrenouncing it.\r\n\r\nShe was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it\r\nwas pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with\r\nattractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman\r\nappeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of\r\nseeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:\r\nSir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from\r\nCelia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for\r\nCelia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself\r\nwould have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all\r\nher eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas\r\nabout marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the\r\njudicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that\r\nwretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his\r\nblindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits\r\nit would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome\r\nbaronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed\r\nuncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful\r\nmarriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and\r\ncould teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.\r\n\r\nThese peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all\r\nthe more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some\r\nmiddle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself\r\ndreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for\r\nsuch a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s\r\nobjections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is\r\nto say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of\r\ngentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So\r\nMiss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all\r\ndislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.\r\n\r\nSir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another\r\ngentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt\r\nsome venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,\r\nnoted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many\r\nyears to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also\r\nas a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views\r\nof his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication\r\nof his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be\r\nmeasured without a precise chronology of scholarship.\r\n\r\nEarly in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she\r\nhad set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the\r\npretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on\r\nfinishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted\r\nin), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to\r\npropose something, said—\r\n\r\n“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we\r\nlooked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six\r\nmonths to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at\r\nthem yet.”\r\n\r\nCelia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full\r\npresence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and\r\nprinciple; two associated facts which might show a mysterious\r\nelectricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s\r\neyes were full of laughter as she looked up.\r\n\r\n“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or\r\nsix lunar months?”\r\n\r\n“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April\r\nwhen uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten\r\nthem till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you\r\nlocked them up in the cabinet here.”\r\n\r\n“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a\r\nfull cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil\r\nin her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.\r\n\r\nCelia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in\r\nrespect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.\r\nAnd,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of\r\nmortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who\r\nwas stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.\r\nAnd Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore\r\njewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really\r\napplied herself to argument.\r\n\r\n“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished\r\ndiscovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she\r\nhad caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of\r\ncourse, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But\r\nthe keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her\r\nhead and seemed to despair of her memory.\r\n\r\n“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long\r\nmeditated and prearranged.\r\n\r\n“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”\r\n\r\nThe casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread\r\nout, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,\r\nbut a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest\r\nthat was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in\r\nexquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.\r\nDorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her\r\nsister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the\r\ncircle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and\r\nshe could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.\r\n\r\n“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this\r\ncross you must wear with your dark dresses.”\r\n\r\nCelia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the\r\ncross yourself.”\r\n\r\n“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless\r\ndeprecation.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”\r\nsaid Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”\r\n\r\n“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I\r\nwould wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.\r\n\r\n“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.\r\n\r\n“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have\r\ncomplexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”\r\n\r\n“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”\r\n\r\n“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so\r\nfond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need\r\ndiscuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”\r\n\r\nCelia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority\r\nin this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of\r\nan unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.\r\n\r\n“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will\r\nnever wear them?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to\r\nkeep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I\r\nshould feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with\r\nme, and I should not know how to walk.”\r\n\r\nCelia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a\r\nlittle tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit\r\nyou better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness\r\nof the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia\r\nhappier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed\r\na fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a\r\ncloud sent a bright gleam over the table.\r\n\r\n“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current\r\nof feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors\r\nseem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why\r\ngems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They\r\nlook like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful\r\nthan any of them.”\r\n\r\n“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice\r\nthis at first.”\r\n\r\n“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her\r\nfinely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on\r\na level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify\r\nher delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.\r\n\r\n“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,\r\nbeginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,\r\nand also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than\r\npurple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing\r\nelse. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,\r\nletting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what\r\nmiserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She\r\npaused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce\r\nthe ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all\r\nthe rest away, and the casket.”\r\n\r\nShe took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking\r\nat them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at\r\nthese little fountains of pure color.\r\n\r\n“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with\r\nreal curiosity as to what she would do.\r\n\r\nDorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative\r\nadornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen\r\ndiscernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke\r\never attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I\r\nmay sink.”\r\n\r\nCelia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her\r\nsister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the\r\nornaments which she put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea\r\ntoo was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the\r\npurity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with\r\nthat little explosion.\r\n\r\nCelia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the\r\nwrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked\r\nthat question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was\r\ninconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the\r\njewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a\r\nnecklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I\r\nshould be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,\r\nthough of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is\r\nnot always consistent.”\r\n\r\nThus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her\r\nsister calling her.\r\n\r\n“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great\r\narchitect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”\r\n\r\nAs Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her\r\nsister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw\r\nthat she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they\r\ncould remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the\r\nattitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had\r\nalways worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private\r\nopinions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n“‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un\r\ncaballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo\r\nque veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un\r\nas no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que\r\nrelumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don\r\nQuijote.”—CERVANTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray\r\nsteed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is\r\nnothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something\r\nshiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that\r\nresplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling\r\nway, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s\r\nAgricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him\r\nyears ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet\r\nWordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at\r\nCambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined\r\nwith him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in\r\nthings, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,\r\nWordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every\r\nsense, you know.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of\r\ndinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the\r\nmass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man\r\nlike Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she\r\nthought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his\r\ndeep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the\r\nspare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different\r\nas possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type\r\nrepresented by Sir James Chettam.\r\n\r\n“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,\r\n“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see\r\nif something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among\r\nmy tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”\r\n\r\n“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into\r\nelectrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of\r\nyour cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at\r\none time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can\r\nlet nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,\r\nand that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But\r\nyour fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you\r\ncan buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”\r\n\r\n“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out\r\nhow men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in\r\nkeeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make\r\nyourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir\r\nJames had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had\r\noften thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was\r\nher brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was\r\nspeaking, and seemed to observe her newly.\r\n\r\n“Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.\r\nBrooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. “I remember when we were all\r\nreading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas\r\nat one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in\r\ncircles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The\r\nfact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in\r\nfact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.\r\nI pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been\r\nin favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be\r\nlanded back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s\r\n‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous\r\nreason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such\r\nliterature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters\r\nlately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am\r\nfastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect\r\nreader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the\r\ninward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something\r\nlike the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying\r\nmentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and\r\nconfusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution\r\nabout my eyesight.”\r\n\r\nThis was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He\r\ndelivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make\r\na public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,\r\noccasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more\r\nconspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy\r\nslovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most\r\ninteresting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,\r\nthe Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the\r\nWaldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the\r\nhighest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to\r\nassist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted\r\nher above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of\r\npolitical economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an\r\nextinguisher over all her lights.\r\n\r\n“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an\r\nopportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little\r\ninto the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a\r\nchestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw\r\nyou on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My\r\ngroom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention\r\nthe time.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not\r\nride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a\r\nlittle annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when\r\nshe wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.\r\n\r\n“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that\r\nshowed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is\r\nshe not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.\r\n\r\n“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say\r\nsomething that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as\r\npossible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”\r\n\r\n“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not\r\nself-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to\r\ndo what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.\r\n\r\nMr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.\r\nCasaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous\r\nmotive.”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered\r\nDorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from\r\nhigh delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse\r\nSir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to\r\nlisten to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of\r\nallowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then\r\ninforming him that the Reformation either meant something or it did\r\nnot, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism\r\nwas a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist\r\nchapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly\r\nspeaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.\r\n\r\n“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if\r\nto explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all\r\nschools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon said, “No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went\r\ninto Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the\r\nindependent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I\r\nbegan a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but\r\nwhen a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an\r\nanswer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your\r\ndocuments?”\r\n\r\n“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air\r\nof effort.\r\n\r\n“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but\r\neverything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is\r\nin A or Z.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said\r\nDorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects\r\nunder each letter.”\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have\r\nan excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies\r\nmeddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”\r\n\r\nDorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some\r\nspecial reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in\r\nhis mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other\r\nfragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.\r\n\r\nWhen the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—\r\n\r\n“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”\r\n\r\n“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He\r\nis remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep\r\neye-sockets.”\r\n\r\n“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said\r\nDorothea, walking away a little.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”\r\n\r\n“All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a\r\n_cochon de lait_.”\r\n\r\n“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard\r\nyou make such a comparison before.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good\r\ncomparison: the match is perfect.”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.\r\n\r\n“I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”\r\n\r\n“It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as\r\nif they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul\r\nin a man’s face.”\r\n\r\n“Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive\r\nmalice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of\r\ndecision. “Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on\r\nBiblical Cosmology.”\r\n\r\n“He talks very little,” said Celia\r\n\r\n“There is no one for him to talk to.”\r\n\r\nCelia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I\r\nbelieve she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She\r\nhad never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.\r\nSometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a\r\nhusband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in\r\nthe depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too\r\nreligious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt\r\nneedles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even\r\neating.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by\r\nher, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why\r\nshould he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and\r\nmanners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted\r\nby preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly\r\ncharming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his\r\nattachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare\r\nmerit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the\r\nsmallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a\r\nwife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who\r\ncould help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the\r\nproperty qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness\r\nalleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it\r\nconsisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In\r\nshort, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready\r\nto endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could\r\nalways put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should\r\never like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose\r\ncleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has\r\nalways the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is\r\nof a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is\r\nof a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this\r\nestimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with\r\na little gum or starch in the form of tradition.\r\n\r\n“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,\r\nMiss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is\r\nthe most healthy of exercises.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia\r\ngood—if she would take to it.”\r\n\r\n“But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily\r\nthrown.”\r\n\r\n“Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a\r\nperfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”\r\n\r\n“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I\r\nought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond\r\nto your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and\r\nspoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,\r\nin amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.\r\n\r\n“I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is\r\nnot possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”\r\n\r\n“It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\n“We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his\r\nmeasured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in\r\nthe utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep\r\nthe germinating grain away from the light.”\r\n\r\nDorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the\r\nspeaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,\r\nand with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could\r\nilluminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning\r\nalmost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!\r\n\r\nDorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have\r\ngone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,\r\nwhich has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.\r\nHas any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of\r\npre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to\r\ntell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons\r\nwould do her honor.”\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had\r\nlooked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom\r\nhe was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm\r\ntowards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a\r\nclergyman of some distinction.\r\n\r\nHowever, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with\r\nMr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to\r\nCelia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,\r\nand asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,\r\nCelia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the\r\nsecond Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,\r\nthough not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the\r\nelder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all\r\nrespects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to\r\nhaving the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who\r\npretended not to expect it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n“Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,\r\nThe affable archangel . . .\r\n                    Eve\r\nThe story heard attentive, and was filled\r\nWith admiration, and deep muse, to hear\r\nOf things so high and strange.”\r\n—_Paradise Lost_, B. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a\r\nsuitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him\r\nwere already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day\r\nthe reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long\r\nconversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company\r\nof Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to\r\nplay with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.\r\n\r\nDorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of\r\nMr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine\r\nextension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own\r\nexperience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great\r\nwork, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as\r\ninstructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the\r\narchangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what\r\nindeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,\r\njustice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.\r\nCasaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical\r\nfragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally\r\nrevealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm\r\nfooting there, the vast field of mythical constructions became\r\nintelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of\r\ncorrespondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no\r\nlight or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of\r\nvolumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous\r\nstill-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of\r\nHippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to\r\nDorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done\r\nto a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:\r\nit is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the\r\nEnglish with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in\r\nany case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his\r\nacquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,\r\nthat conne Latyn but lytille.”\r\n\r\nDorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this\r\nconception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school\r\nliterature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile\r\ncomplete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who\r\nunited the glories of doctor and saint.\r\n\r\nThe sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when\r\nDorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she\r\ncould speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially\r\non the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of\r\nbelief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self\r\nin communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed\r\nin the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.\r\nCasaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of\r\nhis own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise\r\nconformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a\r\nwhole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his\r\nfeelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little\r\npool!”\r\n\r\nMiss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly\r\nthan other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,\r\nbut interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent\r\nnature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a\r\nsky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of\r\nknowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself\r\nmay have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning\r\nsometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way\r\noff the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and\r\nthen arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in\r\nher trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight pressure of\r\ninvitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own\r\ndocuments on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called\r\ninto the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up\r\nfirst one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and\r\nuncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a\r\n“Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the\r\njournal of his youthful Continental travels.\r\n\r\n“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you\r\nare a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have given much\r\nstudy to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these\r\nthings—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for\r\nParnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about\r\nGreece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely\r\nalong the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in\r\nthe right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as\r\npossible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this\r\ndesultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and\r\nthat the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an\r\namiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance\r\naided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?\r\n\r\nCertainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him, on\r\ndrawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her\r\nhis face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before\r\nhe left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke\r\nalong the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the\r\ndisadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship\r\nwith which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils\r\nof maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful\r\nprecision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be\r\nattended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that\r\nhe should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or\r\npersonal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the\r\n2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of\r\nthat date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a\r\nvolume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not\r\nthe ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten\r\nwriting. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to\r\nbe falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the\r\neager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in\r\nexperience is an epoch.\r\n\r\nIt was three o’clock in the beautiful breezy autumn day when Mr.\r\nCasaubon drove off to his Rectory at Lowick, only five miles from\r\nTipton; and Dorothea, who had on her bonnet and shawl, hurried along\r\nthe shrubbery and across the park that she might wander through the\r\nbordering wood with no other visible companionship than that of Monk,\r\nthe Great St. Bernard dog, who always took care of the young ladies in\r\ntheir walks. There had risen before her the girl’s vision of a possible\r\nfuture for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope, and\r\nshe wanted to wander on in that visionary future without interruption.\r\nShe walked briskly in the brisk air, the color rose in her cheeks, and\r\nher straw bonnet (which our contemporaries might look at with\r\nconjectural curiosity as at an obsolete form of basket) fell a lit"

		    "text": "The Blue Castle, by Lucy Maud Montgomery\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it had not rained on a certain May morning Valancy Stirling’s whole\r\nlife would have been entirely different. She would have gone, with the\r\nrest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington’s engagement picnic and Dr. Trent\r\nwould have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear what\r\nhappened to her because of it.\r\n\r\nValancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding\r\ndawn. She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes,\r\nwhen one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community\r\nand connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to\r\nget a man.\r\n\r\nDeerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless\r\nold maidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a\r\ncertain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way\r\nyet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the\r\nfact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.\r\n\r\nAy, _there_ lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old\r\nmaid. After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as\r\ndreadful as being married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin,\r\nor even an Uncle Herbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a\r\nchance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired her.\r\n\r\nThe tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly\r\ngreying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted\r\nto, for two reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another\r\nattack of that pain around the heart. She had had a spell of it after\r\nshe had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was\r\nafraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at\r\nher with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the\r\ncause thereof.\r\n\r\n“Suppose,” thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the\r\nplain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified\r\nMother would be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old\r\nmaid daughter.”\r\n\r\nBut of course appearances should be kept up. “It is not,” Valancy could\r\nhear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not\r\n_maidenly_ to think about _men_.”\r\n\r\nThe thought of her mother’s expression made Valancy laugh—for she had a\r\nsense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there\r\nwere a good many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her\r\nlaughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled,\r\nfutile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and\r\nwatching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping\r\ninto her ugly, sordid room.\r\n\r\nShe knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The\r\nyellow-painted floor, with one hideous, “hooked” rug by the bed, with a\r\ngrotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke;\r\nthe faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and\r\ncrossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the\r\nbrown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old\r\nlooking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate\r\ndressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her\r\nmythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which\r\nCousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded\r\npincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;\r\nthe faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns\r\nabout Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs\r\nof ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were\r\nonly two pictures that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a\r\npuppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. That picture always made Valancy\r\nunhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the\r\ndriving rain! Why didn’t _some one_ open the door and let him in? The\r\nother picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise\r\ncoming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had lavishly given her on\r\nher tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated\r\nit, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never dared\r\ndestroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been\r\naghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would\r\nhave had a fit.\r\n\r\nEvery room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances\r\nwere kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw.\r\nValancy sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room\r\nherself, even without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had\r\nnegatived every timid suggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy\r\nnever persisted. She was afraid to. Her mother could not brook\r\nopposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if offended, with the\r\nairs of an insulted duchess.\r\n\r\nThe only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone\r\nthere at night to cry if she wanted to.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for\r\nnothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never\r\npermitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. People who\r\nwanted to be alone, so Mrs. Frederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles\r\nbelieved, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. But\r\nher room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.\r\n\r\nValancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life,\r\nwas wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody\r\nin the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of\r\nall her mother and Cousin Stickles. They never knew that Valancy had\r\ntwo homes—the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue\r\nCastle in Spain. Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever\r\nsince she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found\r\nherself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see\r\nit plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain\r\nheight, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies\r\nof a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in\r\nthat castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and\r\nfire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps,\r\nwith great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up\r\nand down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell\r\nand nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that\r\nreflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest\r\nof all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the\r\nboredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night.\r\nMost, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they\r\nhad known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.\r\n\r\nFor one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time.\r\nOne who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry\r\nand won her after long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was\r\nwedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung\r\nchapel of the Blue Castle.\r\n\r\nAt twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly\r\nblue eyes. At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still\r\nnecessarily handsome. At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At\r\ntwenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong\r\nand rugged rather than handsome. Valancy never grew older than\r\ntwenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very recently—her hero had\r\nhad reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a mysterious past.\r\n\r\nI don’t say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew\r\nthem. One simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient\r\nin this respect in Blue Castles.\r\n\r\nBut, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key\r\nof her Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her\r\nheels like a maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely,\r\nundesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with\r\nno past and no future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and\r\ncolourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far\r\nas she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until\r\nshe was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a\r\nwintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to\r\nlive for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the\r\nbitterness of death.\r\n\r\n“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to\r\nlive eighty years,” thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. “We’re all\r\nhorribly long-lived. It sickens me to think of it.”\r\n\r\nShe was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied that\r\nit was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic,\r\nwhereby Aunt and Uncle Wellington—one always thought of them in that\r\nsuccession—inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty\r\nyears before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to\r\nValancy. By an impish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday\r\nand, after she had passed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.\r\n\r\nMuch as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to\r\nher to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the\r\nrevolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly what every one would\r\nsay to her at the picnic. Uncle Wellington, whom she disliked and\r\ndespised even though he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration,\r\n“marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of\r\ngetting married yet, my dear?” and then go off into the bellow of\r\nlaughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks. Aunt\r\nWellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about\r\nOlive’s new chiffon dress and Cecil’s last devoted letter. Valancy\r\nwould have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter\r\nhad been hers or else Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy\r\nhad long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt\r\nWellington, because God might forgive her but Aunt Wellington never\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAunt Alberta, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring\r\nto her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature in the\r\nworld, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her\r\nyouth, would condole with Valancy on her sallow skin—\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When _I_ was\r\na girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in\r\nCanada, my dear.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark\r\njocularly, “How fat you’re getting, Doss!” And then everybody would\r\nlaugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss\r\ngetting fat.\r\n\r\nHandsome, solemn Uncle James, whom Valancy disliked but respected\r\nbecause he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan\r\noracle—brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection—would\r\nprobably remark with the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his\r\nreputation, “I suppose you’re busy with your hope-chest these days?”\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between\r\nwheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.\r\n\r\n“What is the difference between Doss and a mouse?\r\n\r\n“The mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm the\r\nhe’s.”\r\n\r\nValancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she\r\nwanted to throw something at him. But she never did. In the first\r\nplace, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place,\r\nUncle Benjamin was a wealthy and childless old widower and Valancy had\r\nbeen brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she\r\noffended him he would cut her out of his will—supposing she were in it.\r\nValancy did not want to be cut out of Uncle Benjamin’s will. She had\r\nbeen poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it. So she\r\nendured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would\r\ncriticise her in some way—Valancy could not predict just how, for Aunt\r\nIsabel never repeated a criticism—she found something new with which to\r\njab you every time. Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she\r\nthought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said what _they_\r\nthought to _her_. Valancy never said what _she_ thought.\r\n\r\nCousin Georgiana—named after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been\r\nnamed after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all\r\nrelatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder\r\n“which of us will be the first to go next.”\r\n\r\nOppressively competent, Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her\r\nhusband and her odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy\r\nwould be the only one she could find to put up with it. For the same\r\nreason, Cousin Gladys—really First Cousin Gladys once removed,\r\naccording to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated\r\nrelationship—a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive\r\ndisposition, would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis. And\r\nOlive, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had everything\r\nValancy had not—beauty, popularity, love,—would show off her beauty and\r\npresume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in\r\nValancy’s dazzled, envious eyes.\r\n\r\nThere would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up\r\nof teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin\r\nStickles. And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt\r\nWellington’s wedding set had been lost. Valancy never heard the last of\r\nthat silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every\r\nsubsequent family feast.\r\n\r\nOh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she\r\nblessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic\r\nthis year. If Aunt Wellington could not celebrate on the sacred day\r\nitself she would have no celebration at all. Thank whatever gods there\r\nwere for that.\r\n\r\nSince there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the\r\nrain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get\r\nanother of John Foster’s books. Valancy was never allowed to read\r\nnovels, but John Foster’s books were not novels. They were “nature\r\nbooks”—so the librarian told Mrs. Frederick Stirling—“all about the\r\nwoods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.” So Valancy\r\nwas allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident\r\nthat she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, to\r\nread to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was\r\nenjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether her mind was\r\nbeing improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across\r\nJohn Foster’s books years ago life might have been a different thing\r\nfor her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she\r\nmight once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now.\r\nIt was only within the last year that John Foster’s books had been in\r\nthe Deerwood library, though the librarian told Valancy that he had\r\nbeen a well-known writer for several years.\r\n\r\n“Where does he live?” Valancy had asked.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more\r\ninformation can be had. His publishers won’t say a word. Quite likely\r\nJohn Foster is a nom de plume. His books are so popular we can’t keep\r\nthem in at all, though I really can’t see what people find in them to\r\nrave over.”\r\n\r\n“I think they’re wonderful,” said Valancy, timidly.\r\n\r\n“Oh—well—” Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated\r\nValancy’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much for bugs myself.\r\nBut certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.”\r\n\r\nValancy didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not\r\nJohn Foster’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that\r\nenthralled her. She could hardly say what it was—some tantalising lure\r\nof a mystery never revealed—some hint of a great secret just a little\r\nfurther on—some faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things—John\r\nFoster’s magic was indefinable.\r\n\r\nYes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had\r\n_Thistle Harvest_, so surely Mother could not object. Valancy had read\r\nit four times—she knew whole passages off by heart.\r\n\r\nAnd—she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer\r\npain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the\r\npalpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional\r\ndizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath. But could she go to see\r\nhim without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the\r\nStirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and\r\ngetting Uncle James’ approval. _Then_, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh\r\nof Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Adelaide Stirling.\r\n\r\nBut Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh. And, besides, she could not get\r\nto Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She\r\ndid not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a\r\nfuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it\r\nover and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible\r\ntales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just\r\nlike that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear.”\r\n\r\nAunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a\r\ngirl who would have heart trouble—“so pinched and peaked always”; and\r\nUncle Wellington would take it as a personal insult, when “no Stirling\r\never had heart disease before”; and Georgiana would forebode in\r\nperfectly audible asides that “poor, dear little Doss isn’t long for\r\nthis world, I’m afraid”; and Cousin Gladys would say, “Why, _my_ heart\r\nhas been like that for _years_,” in a tone that implied no one else had\r\nany business even to have a heart; and Olive—Olive would merely look\r\nbeautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, as if to say, “Why all\r\nthis fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss when you have _me_?”\r\n\r\nValancy felt that she couldn’t tell anybody unless she had to. She felt\r\nquite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and\r\nno need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She\r\nwould just slip up quietly and see Dr. Trent that very day. As for his\r\nbill, she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the\r\nbank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed to use even\r\nthe interest of this, but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr.\r\nTrent.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was\r\na recognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general\r\npractitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Trent was over seventy\r\nand there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the\r\nStirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten\r\nyears before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed\r\nit. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your\r\nfirst-cousin-once-removed like that—not to mention that he was a\r\nPresbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church. But\r\nValancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of\r\nfuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cousin Stickles knocked at her door, Valancy knew it was half-past\r\nseven and she must get up. As long as she could remember, Cousin\r\nStickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles\r\nand Mrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was\r\nallowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition\r\nthat she was delicate. Valancy got up, though she hated getting up more\r\nthis morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for?\r\nAnother dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of\r\nmeaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited\r\nnobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for\r\nbreakfast at eight o’clock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule\r\nin Mrs. Stirling’s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper\r\nat six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever\r\ntolerated. So up Valancy got, shivering.\r\n\r\nThe room was bitterly cold with the raw, penetrating chill of a wet May\r\nmorning. The house would be cold all day. It was one of Mrs.\r\nFrederick’s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth\r\nof May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch.\r\nAnd though May might be icy and October frost-bitten, no fires were\r\nlighted until the twenty-first of October by the calendar. On the\r\ntwenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking over the kitchen\r\nrange and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings. It\r\nwas whispered about in the connection that the late Frederick Stirling\r\nhad caught the cold which resulted in his death during Valancy’s first\r\nyear of life because Mrs. Frederick would not have a fire on the\r\ntwentieth of October. She lighted it the next day—but that was a day\r\ntoo late for Frederick Stirling.\r\n\r\nValancy took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse,\r\nunbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves. She put on\r\nundergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick,\r\nblack stockings and rubber-heeled boots. Of late years she had fallen\r\ninto the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the\r\nlooking-glass pulled down. The lines on her face did not show so\r\nplainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and\r\nlooked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate determination\r\nto see herself as the world saw her.\r\n\r\nThe result was rather dreadful. Even a beauty would have found that\r\nharsh, unsoftened side-light trying. Valancy saw straight black hair,\r\nshort and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one\r\nhundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her\r\nlife and faithfully rubbed Redfern’s Hair Vigor into the roots, more\r\nlustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black\r\nbrows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her\r\nsmall, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell\r\nopen a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and\r\nflat-breasted, rather below the average height. She had somehow escaped\r\nthe family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and\r\nshadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from\r\nher eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking,\r\nshe concluded bitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth\r\nwere in that merciless light! And never had her narrow, white face\r\nlooked so narrow and so white.\r\n\r\nShe did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone out of\r\nfashion, but they had been in when Valancy first put her hair up and\r\nAunt Wellington had decided that she must always wear her hair so.\r\n\r\n“It is the _only_ way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you\r\n_must_ add height to it by a pompadour effect,” said Aunt Wellington,\r\nwho always enunciated commonplaces as if uttering profound and\r\nimportant truths.\r\n\r\nValancy had hankered to do her hair pulled low on her forehead, with\r\npuffs above the ears, as Olive was wearing hers. But Aunt Wellington’s\r\ndictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change her style\r\nof hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Valancy\r\nnever dared do.\r\n\r\nAll her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly.\r\nFrom the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly\r\nafraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Stickles told her,\r\nin the closet under the stairs.\r\n\r\n“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it. I don’t know what it\r\nwould be like not to be afraid of something.”\r\n\r\nAfraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending Uncle\r\nBenjamin—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Wellington’s\r\ncontempt—afraid of Aunt Isabel’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle James’\r\ndisapproval—afraid of offending the whole clan’s opinions and\r\nprejudices—afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she\r\nreally thought of  anything—afraid of poverty in her old age.\r\nFear—fear—fear—she could never escape from it. It bound her and\r\nenmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle\r\ncould she find temporary release. And this morning Valancy could not\r\nbelieve she had a Blue Castle. She would never be able to find it\r\nagain. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the\r\nfairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle? She would cut such childish\r\nnonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly.\r\n\r\nShe turned from her unfriendly mirror and looked out. The ugliness of\r\nthe view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the\r\ntumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude,\r\nviolently coloured advertisements; the grimy railway station beyond,\r\nwith the awful derelicts that were always hanging around it even at\r\nthis early hour. In the pouring rain everything looked worse than\r\nusual, especially the beastly advertisement, “Keep that schoolgirl\r\ncomplexion.” Valancy _had_ kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was\r\njust the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere—“exactly\r\nlike my life,” thought Valancy drearily. Her brief bitterness had\r\npassed. She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted\r\nthem. She was one of the people whom life always passes by. There was\r\nno altering that fact.\r\n\r\nIn this mood Valancy went down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nBreakfast was always the same. Oatmeal porridge, which Valancy loathed,\r\ntoast and tea, and one teaspoonful of marmalade. Mrs. Frederick thought\r\ntwo teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Valancy, who\r\nhated marmalade, too. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was\r\nchillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed down outside the\r\nwindow; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the\r\npictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Stickles wished\r\nValancy many happy returns of the day!\r\n\r\n“Sit up straight, Doss,” was all her mother said.\r\n\r\nValancy sat up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Stickles\r\nof the things they always talked of. She never wondered what would\r\nhappen if she tried to talk of something else. She knew. Therefore she\r\nnever did it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day\r\nwhen she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky\r\nsilence for which Valancy was rather grateful. But Christine Stickles\r\nwhined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather,\r\nthe leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Valancy felt at\r\nonce she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic of mumps in\r\nDeerwood.\r\n\r\n“Doss will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.\r\n\r\n“Doss must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs.\r\nFrederick shortly.\r\n\r\nValancy had never had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or\r\nmeasles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds\r\nevery winter. Doss’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the\r\nfamily. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them. Mrs.\r\nFrederick and Cousin Stickles did their heroic best. One winter they\r\nkept Valancy housed up from November to May, in the warm sitting-room.\r\nShe was not even allowed to go to church. And Valancy took cold after\r\ncold and ended up with bronchitis in June.\r\n\r\n“None of _my_ family were ever like that,” said Mrs. Frederick,\r\nimplying that it must be a Stirling tendency.\r\n\r\n“The Stirlings seldom take colds,” said Cousin Stickles resentfully.\r\n_She_ had been a Stirling.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Mrs. Frederick, “that if a person makes up her mind\r\n_not_ to have colds she will not _have_ colds.”\r\n\r\nSo that was the trouble. It was all Valancy’s own fault.\r\n\r\nBut on this particular morning Valancy’s unbearable grievance was that\r\nshe was called Doss. She had endured it for twenty-nine years, and all\r\nat once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name was\r\nValancy Jane. Valancy Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Valancy,\r\nwith its odd, out-land tang. It was always a wonder to Valancy that the\r\nStirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that\r\nher maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for\r\nher. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the\r\nwhole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her Doss. She\r\nnever got Valancy from any one but outsiders.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” she said timidly, “would you mind calling me Valancy after\r\nthis? Doss seems so—so—I don’t like it.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Frederick looked at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses\r\nwith enormously strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly\r\ndisagreeable appearance.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with Doss?”\r\n\r\n“It—seems so childish,” faltered Valancy.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Mrs. Frederick had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was\r\nnot an asset. “I see. Well, it should suit _you_ then. You are childish\r\nenough in all conscience, my dear child.”\r\n\r\n“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said\r\nMrs. Frederick. “Twenty-nine! _I_ had been married nine years when I\r\nwas twenty-nine.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Stickles proudly.\r\n\r\nValancy looked at them furtively. Mrs. Frederick, except for those\r\nterrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a\r\nparrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty\r\nshe might have been quite pretty. But Cousin Stickles! And yet\r\nChristine Stickles had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Valancy\r\nfelt that Cousin Stickles, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, a mole\r\nright on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin,\r\nwrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth,\r\nhad yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her. And\r\neven yet Cousin Stickles was necessary to Mrs. Frederick. Valancy\r\nwondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some\r\none—needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed her, or would\r\nmiss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it. She was a\r\ndisappointment to her mother. No one loved her. She had never so much\r\nas had a girl friend.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to\r\nherself pitifully.\r\n\r\n“Doss, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Frederick rebukingly.\r\n\r\nIt rained all the forenoon without cessation. Valancy pieced a quilt.\r\nValancy hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house\r\nwas full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in\r\nthe attic. Mrs. Frederick had begun storing away quilts when Valancy\r\nwas seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem\r\nlikely that Valancy would ever need them. But Valancy must be at work\r\nand fancy work materials were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal\r\nsin in the Stirling household. When Valancy had been a child she had\r\nbeen made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook,\r\nall the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her\r\nmother made her tot them up and pray over them.\r\n\r\nOn this particular forenoon of this day of destiny Valancy spent only\r\nten minutes in idleness. At least, Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles\r\nwould have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better\r\nthimble and she opened _Thistle Harvest_ guiltily at random.\r\n\r\n“The woods are so human,” wrote John Foster, “that to know them one\r\nmust live with them. An occasional saunter through them, keeping to the\r\nwell-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy. If we wish\r\nto be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, reverent\r\nvisits at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all\r\nseasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can\r\nnever really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary\r\nwill never impose on them. They have their own effective way of keeping\r\naliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual\r\nsightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except\r\nsheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their\r\nsweet, old-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them\r\nbecause we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such\r\ntreasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any\r\nmarket-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly\r\nand hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them\r\nlovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what\r\npoignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals,\r\nlying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are\r\nharped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate\r\nsavours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp\r\nbrooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt\r\nthem. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and\r\nits subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever,\r\nso that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be\r\ndrawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.”\r\n\r\n“Doss,” called her mother from the hall below, “what are you doing all\r\nby yourself in that room?”\r\n\r\nValancy dropped _Thistle Harvest_ like a hot coal and fled downstairs\r\nto her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that\r\nalways came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of John\r\nFoster’s books. Valancy did not know much about woods—except the\r\nhaunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle. But she had\r\nalways secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was\r\nthe next best thing to the woods themselves.\r\n\r\nAt noon it stopped raining, but the sun did not come out until three.\r\nThen Valancy timidly said she thought she would go uptown.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to go uptown for?” demanded her mother.\r\n\r\n“I want to get a book from the library.”\r\n\r\n“You got a book from the library only last week.”\r\n\r\n“No, it was four weeks.”\r\n\r\n“Four weeks. Nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Really it was, Mother.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken. It cannot possibly have been more than two weeks. I\r\ndislike contradiction. And I do not see what you want to get a book\r\nfor, anyhow. You waste too much time reading.”\r\n\r\n“Of what value is my time?” asked Valancy bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Doss! Don’t speak in that tone to _me_.”\r\n\r\n“We need some tea,” said Cousin Stickles. “She might go and get that if\r\nshe wants a walk—though this damp weather is bad for colds.”\r\n\r\nThey argued the matter for ten minutes longer and finally Mrs.\r\nFrederick agreed rather grudgingly that Valancy might go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n“Got your rubbers on?” called Cousin Stickles, as Valancy left the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nChristine Stickles had never once forgotten to ask that question when\r\nValancy went out on a damp day.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Have you got your flannel petticoat on?” asked Mrs. Frederick.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Doss, I really do not understand you. Do you want to catch your death\r\nof cold _again_?” Her voice implied that Valancy had died of a cold\r\nseveral times already. “Go upstairs this minute and put it on!”\r\n\r\n“Mother, I don’t _need_ a flannel petticoat. My sateen one is warm\r\nenough.”\r\n\r\n“Doss, remember you had bronchitis two years ago. Go and do as you are\r\ntold!”\r\n\r\nValancy went, though nobody will ever know just how near she came to\r\nhurling the rubber-plant into the street before she went. She hated\r\nthat grey flannel petticoat more than any other garment she owned.\r\nOlive never had to wear flannel petticoats. Olive wore ruffled silk and\r\nsheer lawn and filmy laced flounces. But Olive’s father had “married\r\nmoney” and Olive never had bronchitis. So there you were.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you didn’t leave the soap in the water?” demanded Mrs.\r\nFrederick. But Valancy was gone. She turned at the corner and looked\r\nback down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived. The\r\nStirling house was the ugliest on it—more like a red brick box than\r\nanything else. Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a\r\nbulbous glass cupola on top. About it was the desolate, barren peace of\r\nan old house whose life is lived.\r\n\r\nThere was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed\r\ngables, just around the corner—a new house, one of those houses you\r\nlove the minute you see them. Clayton Markley had built it for his\r\nbride. He was to be married to Jennie Lloyd in June. The little house,\r\nit was said, was furnished from attic to cellar, in complete readiness\r\nfor its mistress.\r\n\r\n“I don’t envy Jennie the man,” thought Valancy sincerely—Clayton\r\nMarkley was not one of her many ideals—“but I _do_ envy her the house.\r\nIt’s such a nice young house. Oh, if I could only have a house of my\r\nown—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own! But then,” she added bitterly,\r\n“there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get a\r\ntallow candle.”\r\n\r\nIn dreamland nothing would do Valancy but a castle of pale sapphire. In\r\nreal life she would have been fully satisfied with a little house of\r\nher own. She envied Jennie Lloyd more fiercely than ever today. Jennie\r\nwas not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much\r\nyounger. Yet she was to have this delightful house. And the nicest\r\nlittle Wedgwood teacups—Valancy had seen them; an open fireplace, and\r\nmonogrammed linen; hemstitched tablecloths, and china-closets. Why did\r\n_everything_ come to some girls and _nothing_ to others? It wasn’t\r\nfair.\r\n\r\nValancy was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, a\r\nprim, dowdy little figure in her shabby raincoat and three-year-old\r\nhat, splashed occasionally by the mud of a passing motor with its\r\ninsulting shrieks. Motors were still rather a novelty in Deerwood,\r\nthough they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer\r\nresidents up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart\r\nset had them; for even Deerwood was divided into sets. There was the\r\nsmart set—the intellectual set—the old-family set—of which the\r\nStirlings were members—the common run, and a few pariahs. Not one of\r\nthe Stirling clan had as yet condescended to a motor, though Olive was\r\nteasing her father to have one. Valancy had never even been in a\r\nmotorcar. But she did not hanker after this. In truth, she felt rather\r\nafraid of motorcars, especially at night. They seemed to be too much\r\nlike big purring beasts that might turn and crush you—or make some\r\nterrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her\r\nBlue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real\r\nlife Valancy would have been quite contented to drive in a buggy behind\r\na nice horse. She got a buggy drive only when some uncle or cousin\r\nremembered to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course she must buy the tea in Uncle Benjamin’s grocery-store. To\r\nbuy it anywhere else was unthinkable. Yet Valancy hated to go to Uncle\r\nBenjamin’s store on her twenty-ninth birthday. There was no hope that\r\nhe would not remember it.\r\n\r\n“Why,” demanded Uncle Benjamin, leeringly, as he tied up her tea, “are\r\nyoung ladies like bad grammarians?”\r\n\r\nValancy, with Uncle Benjamin’s will in the background of her mind, said\r\nmeekly, “I don’t know. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” chuckled Uncle Benjamin, “they can’t decline matrimony.”\r\n\r\nThe two clerks, Joe Hammond and Claude Bertram, chuckled also, and\r\nValancy disliked them a little more than ever. On the first day Claude\r\nBertram had seen her in the store she had heard him whisper to Joe,\r\n“Who is that?” And Joe had said, “Valancy Stirling—one of the Deerwood\r\nold maids.” “Curable or incurable?” Claude had asked with a snicker,\r\nevidently thinking the question very clever. Valancy smarted anew with\r\nthe sting of that old recollection.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-nine,” Uncle Benjamin was saying. “Dear me, Doss, you’re\r\ndangerously near the second corner and not even thinking of getting\r\nmarried yet. Twenty-nine. It seems impossible.”\r\n\r\nThen Uncle Benjamin said an original thing. Uncle Benjamin said, “How\r\ntime does fly!”\r\n\r\n“_I_ think it _crawls_,” said Valancy passionately. Passion was so\r\nalien to Uncle Benjamin’s conception of Valancy that he didn’t know\r\nwhat to make of her. To cover his confusion, he asked another conundrum\r\nas he tied up her beans—Cousin Stickles had remembered at the last\r\nmoment that they must have beans. Beans were cheap and filling.\r\n\r\n“What two ages are apt to prove illusory?” asked Uncle Benjamin; and,\r\nnot waiting for Valancy to “give it up,” he added, “Mir-age and\r\nmarriage.”\r\n\r\n“M-i-r-a-g-e is pronounced _mirazh_,” said Valancy shortly, picking up\r\nher tea and her beans. For the moment she did not care whether Uncle\r\nBenjamin cut her out of his will or not. She walked out of the store\r\nwhile Uncle Benjamin stared after her with his mouth open. Then he\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n“Poor Doss is taking it hard,” he said.\r\n\r\nValancy was sorry by the time she reached the next crossing. Why had\r\nshe lost her patience like that? Uncle Benjamin would be annoyed and\r\nwould likely tell her mother that Doss had been impertinent—“to\r\n_me_!”—and her mother would lecture her for a week.\r\n\r\n“I’ve held my tongue for twenty years,” thought Valancy. “Why couldn’t\r\nI have held it once more?”\r\n\r\nYes, it was just twenty, Valancy reflected, since she had first been\r\ntwitted with her loverless condition. She remembered the bitter moment\r\nperfectly. She was just nine years old and she was standing alone on\r\nthe school playground while the other little girls of her class were\r\nplaying a game in which you must be chosen by a boy as his partner\r\nbefore you could play. Nobody had chosen Valancy—little, pale,\r\nblack-haired Valancy, with her prim, long-sleeved apron and odd,\r\nslanted eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said a pretty little girl to her, “I’m so sorry for you. You\r\nhaven’t got a beau.”\r\n\r\nValancy had said defiantly, as she continued to say for twenty years,\r\n“I don’t _want_ a beau.” But this afternoon Valancy once and for all\r\nstopped saying that.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to be honest with myself anyhow,” she thought savagely.\r\n“Uncle Benjamin’s riddles hurt me because they are true. I _do_ want to\r\nbe married. I want a house of my own—I want a husband of my own—I want\r\nsweet, little fat _babies_ of my own—” Valancy stopped suddenly aghast\r\nat her own recklessness. She felt sure that Rev. Dr. Stalling, who\r\npassed her at this moment, read her thoughts and disapproved of them\r\nthoroughly. Valancy was afraid of Dr. Stalling—had been afraid of him\r\never since the Sunday, twenty-three years before, when he had first\r\ncome to St. Albans’. Valancy had been too late for Sunday School that\r\nday and she had gone into the church timidly and sat in their pew. No\r\none else was in the church—nobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling.\r\nDr. Stalling stood up in front of the choir door, beckoned to her, and\r\nsaid sternly, “Little boy, come up here.”\r\n\r\nValancy had stared around her. There was no little boy—there was no one\r\nin all the huge church but herself. This strange man with the blue\r\nglasses couldn’t mean her. She was not a boy.\r\n\r\n“Little boy,” repeated Dr. Stalling, more sternly still, shaking his\r\nforefinger fiercely at her, “come up here at once!”\r\n\r\nValancy arose as if hypnotised and walked up the aisle. She was too\r\nterrified to do anything else. What dreadful thing was going to happen\r\nto her? What _had_ happened to her? Had she actually turned into a boy?\r\nShe came to a stop in front of Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling shook his\r\nforefinger—such a long, knuckly forefinger—at her and said:\r\n\r\n“Little boy, take off your hat.”\r\n\r\nValancy took off her hat. She had a scrawny little pigtail hanging down\r\nher back, but Dr. Stalling was short-sighted and did not perceive it.\r\n\r\n“Little boy, go back to your seat and _always_ take off your hat in\r\nchurch. _Remember_!”\r\n\r\nValancy went back to her seat carrying her hat like an automaton.\r\nPresently her mother came in.\r\n\r\n“Doss,” said Mrs. Stirling, “what do you mean by taking off your hat?\r\nPut it on instantly!”\r\n\r\nValancy put it on instantly. She was cold with fear lest Dr. Stalling\r\nshould immediately summon her up front again. She would have to go, of\r\ncourse—it never occurred to her that one could disobey the rector—and\r\nthe church was full of people now. Oh, what would she do if that\r\nhorrible, stabbing forefinger were shaken at her again before all those\r\npeople? Valancy sat through the whole service in an agony of dread and\r\nwas sick for a week afterwards. Nobody knew why—Mrs. Frederick again\r\nbemoaned herself of her delicate child.\r\n\r\nDr. Stalling found out his mistake and laughed over it to Valancy—who\r\ndid not laugh. She never got over her dread of Dr. Stalling. And now to\r\nbe caught by him on the street corner, thinking such things!\r\n\r\nValancy got her John Foster book—_Magic of Wings_. “His latest—all\r\nabout birds,” said Miss Clarkson. She had almost decided that she would\r\ngo home, instead of going to see Dr. Trent. Her courage had failed her.\r\nShe was afraid of offending Uncle James—afraid of angering her\r\nmother—afraid of facing gruff, shaggy-browed old Dr. Trent, who would\r\nprobably tell her, as he had told Cousin Gladys, that her trouble was\r\nentirely imaginary and that she only had it because she liked to have\r\nit. No, she would not go; she would get a bottle of Redfern’s Purple\r\nPills instead. Redfern’s Purple Pills were the standard medicine of the\r\nStirling clan. Had they not cured Second Cousin Geraldine when five\r\ndoctors had given her up? Valancy always felt very sceptical concerning\r\nthe virtues of the Purple Pills; but there _might_ be something in\r\nthem; and it was easier to take them than to face Dr. Trent alone. She\r\nwould glance over the magazines in the reading-room a few minutes and\r\nthen go home.\r\n\r\nValancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page\r\nwas a picture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men. And here was\r\nshe, Valancy Stirling, who could not get a solitary beau! Valancy\r\nslammed the magazine shut; she opened _Magic of Wings_. Her eyes fell\r\non the paragraph that changed her life.\r\n\r\n“_Fear is the original sin_,” wrote John Foster. “_Almost all the evil\r\nin the world has its origin in the fact that some one is afraid of\r\nsomething_. It is a cold, slimy serpent coiling about you. It is\r\nhorrible to live with fear; and it is of all things degrading.”\r\n\r\nValancy shut _Magic of Wings_ and stood up. She would go and see Dr.\r\nTrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordeal was not so dreadful, after all. Dr. Trent was as gruff and\r\nabrupt as usual, but he did not tell her ailment was imaginary. After\r\nhe had listened to her symptoms and asked a few questions and made a\r\nquick examination, he sat for a moment looking at her quite intently.\r\nValancy thought he looked as if he were sorry for her. She caught her\r\nbreath for a moment. Was the trouble serious? Oh, it couldn’t be,\r\nsurely—it really hadn’t bothered her _much_—only lately it had got a\r\nlittle worse.\r\n\r\nDr. Trent opened his mouth—but before he could speak the telephone at\r\nhis elbow rang sharply. He picked up the receiver. Valancy, watching\r\nhim, saw his face change suddenly as he listened,\r\n“‘Lo—yes—yes—_what_?—yes—yes”—a brief interval—“My God!”\r\n\r\nDr. Trent dropped the receiver, dashed out of the room and upstairs\r\nwithout even a glance at Valancy. She heard him rushing madly about\r\noverhead, barking out a few remarks to somebody—presumably his\r\nhousekeeper. Then he came tearing downstairs with a club bag in his\r\nhand, snatched his hat and coat from the rack, jerked open the st"

		    "text": "The Enchanted April, by Elizabeth Von Arnim\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n\r\nIt began in a Woman’s Club in London on a February afternoon—an\r\nuncomfortable club, and a miserable afternoon—when Mrs. Wilkins, who\r\nhad come down from Hampstead to shop and had lunched at her club, took\r\nup _The Times_ from the table in the smoking-room, and running her\r\nlistless eye down the Agony Column saw this:\r\n\r\n  To Those who Appreciate Wistaria and Sunshine. Small mediaeval\r\n    Italian Castle on the shores of the Mediterranean to be Let\r\n    Furnished for the month of April. Necessary servants remain. Z,\r\n    Box 1000, _The Times_.\r\n\r\nThat was its conception; yet, as in the case of many another, the\r\nconceiver was unaware of it at the moment.\r\n\r\nSo entirely unaware was Mrs. Wilkins that her April for that year had\r\nthen and there been settled for her that she dropped the newspaper with\r\na gesture that was both irritated and resigned, and went over to the\r\nwindow and stared drearily out at the dripping street.\r\n\r\nNot for her were mediaeval castles, even those that are specially\r\ndescribed as small. Not for her the shores in April of the\r\nMediterranean, and the wistaria and sunshine. Such delights were only\r\nfor the rich. Yet the advertisement had been addressed to persons who\r\nappreciate these things, so that it had been, anyhow, addressed too\r\nto her, for she certainly appreciated them; more than anybody knew;\r\nmore than she had ever told. But she was poor. In the whole world she\r\npossessed of her very own only ninety pounds, saved from year to year,\r\nput by carefully pound by pound, out of her dress allowance. She had\r\nscraped this sum together at the suggestion of her husband as a shield\r\nand refuge against a rainy day. Her dress allowance, given her by her\r\nfather, was £100 a year, so that Mrs. Wilkins’s clothes were what\r\nher husband, urging her to save, called modest and becoming, and her\r\nacquaintance to each other, when they spoke of her at all, which was\r\nseldom for she was very negligible, called a perfect sight.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilkins, a solicitor, encouraged thrift, except that branch of it\r\nwhich got into his food. He did not call that thrift, he called it bad\r\nhousekeeping. But for the thrift which, like moth, penetrated into Mrs.\r\nWilkins’s clothes and spoilt them, he had much praise. “You never\r\nknow,” he said, “when there will be a rainy day, and you may be very\r\nglad to find you have a nest-egg. Indeed we both may.”\r\n\r\nLooking out of the club window into Shaftesbury Avenue—hers was an\r\neconomical club, but convenient for Hampstead, where she lived, and for\r\nShoolbred’s, where she shopped—Mrs. Wilkins, having stood there some\r\ntime very drearily, her mind’s eye on the Mediterranean in April, and\r\nthe wistaria, and the enviable opportunities of the rich, while her\r\nbodily eye watched the really extremely horrible sooty rain falling\r\nsteadily on the hurrying umbrellas and splashing omnibuses, suddenly\r\nwondered whether perhaps this was not the rainy day Mellersh—Mellersh\r\nwas Mr. Wilkins—had so often encouraged her to prepare for, and whether\r\nto get out of such a climate and into the small mediaeval castle wasn’t\r\nperhaps what Providence had all along intended her to do with her\r\nsavings. Part of her savings, of course; perhaps quite a small part.\r\nThe castle, being mediaeval, might also be dilapidated, and\r\ndilapidations were surely cheap. She wouldn’t in the least mind a few\r\nof them, because you didn’t pay for dilapidations which were already\r\nthere; on the contrary—by reducing the price you had to pay they really\r\npaid you. But what nonsense to think of it . . .\r\n\r\nShe turned away from the window with the same gesture of mingled\r\nirritation and resignation with which she had laid down _The Times_,\r\nand crossed the room towards the door with the intention of getting her\r\nmackintosh and umbrella and fighting her way into one of the\r\novercrowded omnibuses and going to Shoolbred’s on her way home and\r\nbuying some soles for Mellersh’s dinner—Mellersh was difficult with\r\nfish and liked only soles, except salmon—when she beheld Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, a woman she knew by sight as also living in Hampstead and\r\nbelonging to the club, sitting at the table in the middle of the room\r\non which the newspapers and magazines were kept, absorbed, in her turn,\r\nin the first page of _The Times_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins had never yet spoken to Mrs. Arbuthnot, who belonged to\r\none of the various church sets, and who analysed, classified, divided\r\nand registered the poor; whereas she and Mellersh, when they did go\r\nout, went to the parties of impressionist painters, of whom in\r\nHampstead there were many. Mellersh had a sister who had married one of\r\nthem and lived up on the Heath, and because of this alliance Mrs.\r\nWilkins was drawn into a circle which was highly unnatural to her, and\r\nshe had learned to dread pictures. She had to say things about them,\r\nand she didn’t know what to say. She used to murmur, “Marvellous,” and\r\nfeel that it was not enough. But nobody minded. Nobody listened. Nobody\r\ntook any notice of Mrs. Wilkins. She was the kind of person who is not\r\nnoticed at parties. Her clothes, infested by thrift, made her\r\npractically invisible; her face was non-arresting; her conversation was\r\nreluctant; she was shy. And if one’s clothes and face and conversation\r\nare all negligible, thought Mrs. Wilkins, who recognised her\r\ndisabilities, what, at parties, is there left of one?\r\n\r\nAlso she was always with Wilkins, that clean-shaven, fine-looking man,\r\nwho gave a party, merely by coming to it, a great air. Wilkins was\r\nvery respectable. He was known to be highly thought of by his senior\r\npartners. His sister’s circle admired him. He pronounced adequately\r\nintelligent judgments on art and artists. He was pithy; he was prudent;\r\nhe never said a word too much, nor, on the other hand, did he ever\r\nsay a word too little. He produced the impression of keeping copies\r\nof everything he said; and he was so obviously reliable that it often\r\nhappened that people who met him at these parties became discontented\r\nwith their own solicitors, and after a period of restlessness\r\nextricated themselves and went to Wilkins.\r\n\r\nNaturally Mrs. Wilkins was blotted out. “She,” said his sister, with\r\nsomething herself of the judicial, the digested, and the final in her\r\nmanner, “should stay at home.” But Wilkins could not leave his wife at\r\nhome. He was a family solicitor, and all such have wives and show them.\r\nWith his in the week he went to parties, and with his on Sundays he\r\nwent to church. Being still fairly young—he was thirty-nine—and\r\nambitious of old ladies, of whom he had not yet acquired in his\r\npractice a sufficient number, he could not afford to miss church, and\r\nit was there that Mrs. Wilkins became familiar, though never through\r\nwords, with Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nShe saw her marshalling the children of the poor into pews. She would\r\ncome in at the head of the procession from the Sunday School exactly\r\nfive minutes before the choir, and get her boys and girls neatly fitted\r\ninto their allotted seats, and down on their little knees in their\r\npreliminary prayer, and up again on their feet just as, to the swelling\r\norgan, the vestry door opened, and the choir and clergy, big with the\r\nlitanies and commandments they were presently to roll out, emerged. She\r\nhad a sad face, yet she was evidently efficient. The combination used\r\nto make Mrs. Wilkins wonder, for she had been told by Mellersh, on days\r\nwhen she had only been able to get plaice, that if one were efficient\r\none wouldn’t be depressed, and that if one does one’s job well one\r\nbecomes automatically bright and brisk.\r\n\r\nAbout Mrs. Arbuthnot there was nothing bright and brisk, though much in\r\nher way with the Sunday School children that was automatic; but when\r\nMrs. Wilkins, turning from the window, caught sight of her in the club\r\nshe was not being automatic at all, but was looking fixedly at one\r\nportion of the first page of _The Times_, holding the paper quite\r\nstill, her eyes not moving. She was just staring; and her face, as\r\nusual, was the face of a patient and disappointed Madonna.\r\n\r\nObeying an impulse she wondered at even while obeying it, Mrs. Wilkins,\r\nthe shy and the reluctant, instead of proceeding as she had intended to\r\nthe cloakroom and from thence to Schoolbred’s in search of Mellersh’s\r\nfish, stopped at the table and sat down exactly opposite Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot, to whom she had never yet spoken in her life.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those long, narrow refectory tables, so that they were\r\nquite close to each other.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, however, did not look up. She continued to gaze, with\r\neyes that seemed to be dreaming, at one spot only of The Times.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins watched her a minute, trying to screw up courage to speak\r\nto her. She wanted to ask her if she had seen the advertisement. She\r\ndid not know why she wanted to ask her this, but she wanted to. How\r\nstupid not to be able to speak to her. She looked so kind. She looked\r\nso unhappy. Why couldn’t two unhappy people refresh each other on their\r\nway through this dusty business of life by a little talk—real, natural\r\ntalk, about what they felt, what they would have liked, what they still\r\ntried to hope? And she could not help thinking that Mrs. Arbuthnot,\r\ntoo, was reading that very same advertisement. Her eyes were on the\r\nvery part of the paper. Was she, too, picturing what it would be\r\nlike—the colour, the fragrance, the light, the soft lapping of the sea\r\namong little hot rocks? Colour, fragrance, light, sea; instead of\r\nShaftesbury Avenue, and the wet omnibuses, and the fish department at\r\nShoolbred’s, and the Tube to Hampstead, and dinner, and to-morrow the\r\nsame and the day after the same and always the same . . .\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mrs. Wilkins found herself leaning across the table. “Are you\r\nreading about the mediaeval castle and the wistaria?” she heard herself\r\nasking.\r\n\r\nNaturally Mrs. Arbuthnot was surprised; but she was not half so much\r\nsurprised as Mrs. Wilkins was at herself for asking.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot had not yet to her knowledge set eyes on the shabby,\r\nlank, loosely-put-together figure sitting opposite her, with its small\r\nfreckled face and big grey eyes almost disappearing under a\r\nsmashed-down wet-weather hat, and she gazed at her a moment without\r\nanswering. She _was_ reading about the mediaeval castle and the\r\nwistaria, or rather had read about it ten minutes before, and since\r\nthen had been lost in dreams—of light, of colour, of fragrance, of the\r\nsoft lapping of the sea among little hot rocks . . .\r\n\r\n“Why do you ask me that?” she said in her grave voice, for her training\r\nof and by the poor had made her grave and patient.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins flushed and looked excessively shy and frightened. “Oh,\r\nonly because I saw it too, and I thought perhaps—I thought somehow—”\r\nshe stammered.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Mrs. Arbuthnot, her mind being used to getting people into\r\nlists and divisions, from habit considered, as she gazed thoughtfully\r\nat Mrs. Wilkins, under what heading, supposing she had to classify her,\r\nshe could most properly be put.\r\n\r\n“And I know you by sight,” went on Mrs. Wilkins, who, like all the shy,\r\nonce she was started plunged on, frightening herself to more and more\r\nspeech by the sheer sound of what she had said last in her ears. “Every\r\nSunday—I see you every Sunday in church—”\r\n\r\n“In church?” echoed Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“And this seems such a wonderful thing—this advertisement about the\r\nwistaria—and—”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins, who must have been at least thirty, broke off and\r\nwriggled in her chair with the movement of an awkward and embarrassed\r\nschoolgirl.\r\n\r\n“It seems _so_ wonderful,” she went on in a kind of burst, “and—it is\r\nsuch a miserable day . . .”\r\n\r\nAnd then she sat looking at Mrs. Arbuthnot with the eyes of an\r\nimprisoned dog.\r\n\r\n“This poor thing,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose life was spent in\r\nhelping and alleviating, “needs advice.”\r\n\r\nShe accordingly prepared herself patiently to give it.\r\n\r\n“If you see me in church,” she said, kindly and attentively, “I suppose\r\nyou live in Hampstead too?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins. And she repeated, her head on its long\r\nthin neck drooping a little as if the recollection of Hampstead bowed\r\nher, “Oh yes.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot, who, when advice was needed, naturally\r\nfirst proceeded to collect the facts.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, laying her hand softly and caressingly on the part\r\nof _The Times_ where the advertisement was, as though the mere printed\r\nwords of it were precious, only said, “Perhaps that’s why _this_ seems\r\nso wonderful.”\r\n\r\n“No—I think _that’s_ wonderful anyhow,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, forgetting\r\nfacts and faintly sighing.\r\n\r\n“Then you _were_ reading it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, her eyes going dreamy again.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t it be wonderful?” murmured Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Wonderful,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot. Her face, which had lit up, faded\r\ninto patience again. “Very wonderful,” she said. “But it’s no use\r\nwasting one’s time thinking of such things.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it _is_,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s quick, surprising reply;\r\nsurprising because it was so much unlike the rest of her—the\r\ncharacterless coat and skirt, the crumpled hat, the undecided wisp of\r\nhair straggling out. “And just the considering of them is worth while\r\nin itself—such a change from Hampstead—and sometimes I believe—I really\r\ndo believe—if one considers hard enough one gets things.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot observed her patiently. In what category would she,\r\nsupposing she had to, put her?\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” she said, leaning forward a little, “you will tell me your\r\nname. If we are to be friends”—she smiled her grave smile—“as I hope we\r\nare, we had better begin at the beginning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes—how kind of you. I’m Mrs. Wilkins,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “I don’t\r\nexpect,” she added, flushing, as Mrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, “that it\r\nconveys anything to you. Sometimes it—it doesn’t seem to convey\r\nanything to me either. But”—she looked round with a movement of seeking\r\nhelp—“I _am_ Mrs. Wilkins.”\r\n\r\nShe did not like her name. It was a mean, small name, with a kind of\r\nfacetious twist, she thought, about its end like the upward curve of a\r\npugdog’s tail. There it was, however. There was no doing anything with\r\nit. Wilkins she was and Wilkins she would remain; and though her\r\nhusband encouraged her to give it on all occasions as Mrs.\r\nMellersh-Wilkins she only did that when he was within earshot, for she\r\nthought Mellersh made Wilkins worse, emphasising it in the way\r\nChatsworth on the gate-posts of a villa emphasises the villa.\r\n\r\nWhen first he suggested she should add Mellersh she had objected for\r\nthe above reason, and after a pause—Mellersh was much too prudent to\r\nspeak except after a pause, during which presumably he was taking a\r\ncareful mental copy of his coming observation—he said, much displeased,\r\n“But I am not a villa,” and looked at her as he looks who hopes, for\r\nperhaps the hundredth time, that he may not have married a fool.\r\n\r\nOf course he was not a villa, Mrs. Wilkins assured him; she had never\r\nsupposed he was; she had not dreamed of meaning . . . she was only just\r\nthinking . . .\r\n\r\nThe more she explained the more earnest became Mellersh’s hope,\r\nfamiliar to him by this time, for he had then been a husband for two\r\nyears, that he might not by any chance have married a fool; and they\r\nhad a prolonged quarrel, if that can be called a quarrel which is\r\nconducted with dignified silence on one side and earnest apology on the\r\nother, as to whether or no Mrs. Wilkins had intended to suggest that\r\nMr. Wilkins was a villa.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” she had thought when it was at last over—it took a long\r\nwhile—“that _anybody_ would quarrel about _anything_ when they’ve not\r\nleft off being together for a single day for two whole years. What we\r\nboth need is a holiday.”\r\n\r\n“My husband,” went on Mrs. Wilkins to Mrs. Arbuthnot, trying to throw\r\nsome light on herself, “is a solicitor. He—” She cast about for\r\nsomething she could say elucidatory of Mellersh, and found: “He’s very\r\nhandsome.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot kindly, “that must be a great pleasure to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, a little taken aback, for constant\r\nintercourse with the poor had accustomed her to have her pronouncements\r\naccepted without question, “because beauty—handsomeness—is a gift like\r\nany other, and if it is properly used—”\r\n\r\nShe trailed off into silence. Mrs. Wilkins’s great grey eyes were fixed\r\non her, and it seemed suddenly to Mrs. Arbuthnot that perhaps she was\r\nbecoming crystallised into a habit of exposition, and of exposition\r\nafter the manner of nursemaids, through having an audience that\r\ncouldn’t but agree, that would be afraid, if it wished, to interrupt,\r\nthat didn’t know, that was, in fact, at her mercy.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins was not listening; for just then, absurd as it seemed,\r\na picture had flashed across her brain, and there were two figures in\r\nit sitting together under a great trailing wistaria that stretched\r\nacross the branches of a tree she didn’t know, and it was herself and\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot—she saw them—she saw them. And behind them, bright in\r\nsunshine, were old grey walls—the mediaeval castle—she saw it—they\r\nwere there . . .\r\n\r\nShe therefore stared at Mrs. Arbuthnot and did not hear a word she\r\nsaid. And Mrs. Arbuthnot stared too at Mrs. Wilkins, arrested by the\r\nexpression on her face, which was swept by the excitement of what she\r\nsaw, and was as luminous and tremulous under it as water in sunlight\r\nwhen it is ruffled by a gust of wind. At this moment, if she had been\r\nat a party, Mrs. Wilkins would have been looked at with interest.\r\n\r\nThey stared at each other; Mrs. Arbuthnot surprised, inquiringly, Mrs.\r\nWilkins with the eyes of some one who has had a revelation. Of course.\r\nThat was how it could be done. She herself, she by herself, couldn’t\r\nafford it, and wouldn’t be able, even if she could afford it, to go\r\nthere all alone; but she and Mrs. Arbuthnot together . . .\r\n\r\nShe leaned across the table. “Why don’t we try and get it?” she\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot became even more wide-eyed. “Get it?” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, still as though she were afraid of being\r\noverheard. “Not just sit here and say How wonderful, and then go home\r\nto Hampstead without having put out a finger—go home just as usual and\r\nsee about the dinner and the fish just as we’ve been doing for years\r\nand years and will go on doing for years and years. In fact,” said Mrs.\r\nWilkins, flushing to the roots of her hair, for the sound of what she\r\nwas saying, of what was coming pouring out, frightened her, and yet she\r\ncouldn’t stop, “I see no end to it. There is no end to it. So that\r\nthere ought to be a break, there ought to be intervals—in everybody’s\r\ninterests. Why, it would really be being unselfish to go away and be\r\nhappy for a little, because we would come back so much nicer. You see,\r\nafter a bit everybody needs a holiday.”\r\n\r\n“But—how do you mean, get it?” asked Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\n“Take it,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Take it?”\r\n\r\n“Rent it. Hire it. Have it.”\r\n\r\n“But—do you mean you and I?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Between us. Share. Then it would only cost half, and you look\r\nso—you look exactly as if you wanted it just as much as I do—as if you\r\nought to have a rest—have something happy happen to you.”\r\n\r\n“Why, but we don’t know each other.”\r\n\r\n“But just think how well we would if we went away together for a month!\r\nAnd I’ve saved for a rainy day, and I expect so have you, and this _is_\r\nthe rainy day—look at it—”\r\n\r\n“She is unbalanced,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot; yet she felt strangely\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\n“Think of getting away for a whole month—from everything—to heaven—”\r\n\r\n“She shouldn’t say things like that,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. “The\r\nvicar—” Yet she felt strangely stirred. It would indeed be wonderful to\r\nhave a rest, a cessation.\r\n\r\nHabit, however, steadied her again; and years of intercourse with the\r\npoor made her say, with the slight though sympathetic superiority of\r\nthe explainer, “But then, you see, heaven isn’t somewhere else. It is\r\nhere and now. We are told so.”\r\n\r\nShe became very earnest, just as she did when trying patiently to help\r\nand enlighten the poor. “Heaven is within us,” she said in her gentle\r\nlow voice. “We are told that on the very highest authority. And you\r\nknow the lines about the kindred points, don’t you—”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I know _them_,” interrupted Mrs. Wilkins impatiently.\r\n\r\n“The kindred points of heaven and home,” continued Mrs. Arbuthnot, who\r\nwas used to finishing her sentences. “Heaven is in our home.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins, again surprisingly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot was taken aback. Then she said gently, “Oh, but it is.\r\nIt is there if we choose, if we make it.”\r\n\r\n“I do choose, and I do make it, and it isn’t,” said Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Arbuthnot was silent, for she too sometimes had doubts about\r\nhomes. She sat and looked uneasily at Mrs. Wilkins, feeling more and\r\nmore the urgent need to getting her classified. If she could only\r\nclassify Mrs. Wilkins, get her safely under her proper heading, she\r\nfelt that she herself would regain her balance, which did seem very\r\nstrangely to be slipping all to one side. For neither had she had a\r\nholiday for years, and the advertisement when she saw it had set her\r\ndreaming, and Mrs. Wilkins’s excitement about it was infectious, and\r\nshe had the sensation, as she listened to her impetuous, odd talk and\r\nwatched her lit-up face, that she was being stirred out of sleep.\r\n\r\nClearly Mrs. Wilkins was unbalanced, but Mrs. Arbuthnot had met the\r\nunbalanced before—indeed she was always meeting them—and they had no\r\neffect on her own stability at all; whereas this one was making her\r\nfeel quite wobbly, quite as though to be off and away, away from her\r\ncompass points of God, Husband, Home and Duty—she didn’t feel as if\r\nMrs. Wilkins intended Mr. Wilkins to come too—and just for once be\r\nhappy, would be both good and desirable. Which of course it wasn’t;\r\nwhich certainly of course it wasn’t. She, also, had a nest-egg,\r\ninvested gradually in the Post Office Savings Bank, but to suppose that\r\nshe would ever forget her duty to the extent of drawing it out and\r\nspending it on herself was surely absurd. Surely she couldn’t, she\r\nwouldn’t ever do such a thing? Surely she wouldn’t, she couldn’t ever\r\nforget her poor, forget misery and sickness as completely as that? No\r\ndoubt a trip to Italy would be extraordinarily delightful, but there\r\nwere many delightful things one would like to do, and what was strength\r\ngiven to one for except to help one not to do them?\r\n\r\nSteadfast as the points of the compass to Mrs. Arbuthnot were the great\r\nfour facts of life: God, Husband, Home, Duty. She had gone to sleep on\r\nthese facts years ago, after a period of much misery, her head resting\r\non them as on a pillow; and she had a great dread of being awakened out\r\nof so simple and untroublesome a condition. Therefore it was that she\r\nsearched with earnestness for a heading under which to put Mrs.\r\nWilkins, and in this way illumine and steady her own mind; and sitting\r\nthere looking at her uneasily after her last remark, and feeling\r\nherself becoming more and more unbalanced and infected, she decided\r\n_pro tem_, as the vicar said at meetings, to put her under the heading\r\nNerves. It was just possible that she ought to go straight into the\r\ncategory Hysteria, which was often only the antechamber to Lunacy, but\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot had learned not to hurry people into their final\r\ncategories, having on more than one occasion discovered with dismay\r\nthat she had made a mistake; and how difficult it had been to get them\r\nout again, and how crushed she had been with the most terrible remorse.\r\n\r\nYes. Nerves. Probably she had no regular work for others, thought Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot; no work that would take her outside herself. Evidently she\r\nwas rudderless—blown about by gusts, by impulses. Nerves was almost\r\ncertainly her category, or would be quite soon if no one helped her.\r\nPoor little thing, thought Mrs. Arbuthnot, her own balance returning\r\nhand in hand with her compassion, and unable, because of the table,\r\nto see the length of Mrs. Wilkins’s legs. All she saw was her small,\r\neager, shy face, and her thin shoulders, and the look of childish\r\nlonging in her eyes for something that she was sure was going to make\r\nher happy. No; such things didn’t make people happy, such fleeting\r\nthings. Mrs. Arbuthnot had learned in her long life with Frederick—he\r\nwas her husband, and she had married him at twenty and was now\r\nthirty-three—where alone true joys are to be found. They are to be\r\nfound, she now knew, only in daily, in hourly, living for others;\r\nthey are to be found only—hadn’t she over and over again taken her\r\ndisappointments and discouragements there, and come away comforted?—at\r\nthe feet of God.\r\n\r\nFrederick had been the kind of husband whose wife betakes herself early\r\nto the feet of God. From him to them had been a short though painful\r\nstep. It seemed short to her in retrospect, but it had really taken the\r\nwhole of the first year of their marriage, and every inch of the way\r\nhad been a struggle, and every inch of it was stained, she felt at the\r\ntime, with her heart’s blood. All that was over now. She had long since\r\nfound peace. And Frederick, from her passionately loved bridegroom,\r\nfrom her worshipped young husband, had become second only to God on\r\nher list of duties and forbearances. There he hung, the second in\r\nimportance, a bloodless thing bled white by her prayers. For years she\r\nhad been able to be happy only by forgetting happiness. She wanted to\r\nstay like that. She wanted to shut out everything that would remind her\r\nof beautiful things, that might set her off again longing, desiring....\r\n\r\n“I’d like so much to be friends,” she said earnestly. “Won’t you come\r\nand see me, or let me come to you sometimes? Whenever you feel as if\r\nyou wanted to talk. I’ll give you my address”—she searched in her\r\nhandbag—“and then you won’t forget.” And she found a card and held it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilkins ignored the card.\r\n\r\n“It’s so funny,” said Mrs. Wilkins, just as if she had not heard her,\r\n“but I _see_ us both—you and me—this April in the mediaeval castle.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot relapsed into uneasiness. “Do you?” she said, making an\r\neffort to stay balanced under the visionary gaze of the shining grey\r\neyes. “Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you ever see things in a kind of flash before they happen?”\r\nasked Mrs. Wilkins.\r\n\r\n“Never,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\r\n\r\nShe tried to smile; she tried to smile the sympathetic yet wise\r\nand tolerant smile with which she was accustomed to listen to the\r\nnecessarily biassed and incomplete views of the poor. She didn’t\r\nsucceed. The smile trembled out.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” she said in a low voice, almost as if she were afraid the\r\nvicar and the Savings Bank were listening, “it would be most\r\nbeautiful—most beautiful—”\r\n\r\n“Even if it were wrong,” said Mrs. Wilkins, “it would only be for a\r\nmonth.”\r\n\r\n“That—” began Mrs. Arbuthnot, quite clear as to the reprehensibleness\r\nof such a point of view; but Mrs. Wilkins stopped her before she could\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\n“Anyhow,” said Mrs. Wilkins, stopping her, “I’m sure it’s wrong to go\r\non being good for too long, till one gets miserable. And I can see\r\nyou’ve been good for years and years, because you look so unhappy”—Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot opened her mouth to protest—“and I—I’ve done nothing but\r\nduties, things for other people, ever since I was a girl, and I don’t\r\nbelieve anybody loves me a bit—a bit—the b-better—and I long—oh, I\r\nlong—for something else—something else—”\r\n\r\nWas she going to cry? Mrs. Arbuthnot became acutely uncomfortable and\r\nsympathetic. She hoped she wasn’t going to cry. Not there. Not in that\r\nunfriendly room, with strangers coming and going.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Wilkins, after tugging agitatedly at a handkerchief that\r\nwouldn’t come out of her pocket, did succeed at last in merely\r\napparently blowing her nose with it, and then, blinking her eyes very\r\nquickly once or twice, looked at Mrs. Arbuthnot with a quivering air of\r\nhalf humble, half frightened apology, and smiled.\r\n\r\n“Will you believe,” she whispered, trying to steady her mouth,\r\nevidently dreadfully ashamed of herself, “that I’ve never spoken to any\r\none before in my life like this? I can’t think, I simply don’t know,\r\nwhat has come over me.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the advertisement,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot, nodding gravely.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Wilkins, dabbing furtively at her eyes, “and us both\r\nbeing so—”—she blew her nose again a little—“miserable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Mrs. Arbuthnot was not miserable—how could she be, she asked\r\nherself, when God was taking care of her?—but she let that pass for the\r\nmoment unrepudiated, because of her conviction that here was another\r\nfellow-creature in urgent need of her help; and not just boots and\r\nblankets and better sanitary arrangements this time, but the more\r\ndelicate help of comprehension, of finding the exact right words.\r\n\r\nThe exact right words, she presently discovered, after trying various\r\nones about living for others, and prayer, and the peace to be found in\r\nplacing oneself unreservedly in God’s hands—to meet all these words\r\nMrs. Wilkins had other words, incoherent and yet, for the moment at\r\nleast, till one had had more time, difficult to answer—the exact right\r\nwords were a suggestion that it would do no harm to answer the\r\nadvertisement. Non-committal. Mere inquiry. And what disturbed Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot about this suggestion was that she did not make it solely to\r\ncomfort Mrs. Wilkins; she made it because of her own strange longing\r\nfor the mediaeval castle.\r\n\r\nThis was very disturbing. There she was, accustomed to direct, to lead,\r\nto advise, to support—except Frederick; she long since had learned to\r\nleave Frederick to God—being led herself, being influenced and thrown\r\noff her feet, by just an advertisement, by just an incoherent stranger.\r\nIt was indeed disturbing. She failed to understand her sudden longing\r\nfor what was, after all, self-indulgence, when for years no such desire\r\nhad entered her heart.\r\n\r\n“There’s no harm in simply _asking_,” she said in a low voice, as if\r\nthe vicar and the Savings Bank and all her waiting and dependent poor\r\nwere listening and condemning.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t as if it _committed_ us to anything,” said Mrs. Wilkins, also\r\nin a low voice, but her voice shook.\r\n\r\nThey got up simultaneously—Mrs. Arbuthnot had a sensation of surprise\r\nthat Mrs. Wilkins should be so tall—and went to a writing-table, and\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot wrote to Z, Box 1000, _The Times_, for particulars. She\r\nasked for all particulars, but the only one they really wanted was the\r\none about the rent. They both felt that it was Mrs. Arbuthnot who ought\r\nto write the letter and do the business part. Not only was she used to\r\norganising and being practical, but she also was older, and certainly\r\ncalmer; and she herself had no doubt too that she was wiser. Neither\r\nhad Mrs. Wilkins any doubt of this; the very way Mrs. Arbuthnot parted\r\nher hair suggested a great calm that could only proceed from wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut if she was wiser, older and calmer, Mrs. Arbuthnot’s new friend\r\nnevertheless seemed to her to be the one who impelled. Incoherent, she\r\nyet impelled. She appeared to have, apart from her need of help, an\r\nupsetting kind of character. She had a curious infectiousness. She led\r\none on. And the way her unsteady mind leaped at conclusions—wrong ones,\r\nof course; witness the one that she, Mrs. Arbuthnot, was miserable—the\r\nway she leaped at conclusions was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nWhatever she was, however, and whatever her unsteadiness, Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot found herself sharing her excitement and her longing; and\r\nwhen the letter had been posted in the letter-box in the hall and\r\nactually was beyond getting back again, both she and Mrs. Wilkins felt\r\nthe same sense of guilt.\r\n\r\n“It only shows,” said Mrs. Wilkins in a whisper, as they turned away\r\nfrom the letter-box, “how immaculately good we’ve been all our lives.\r\nThe very first time we do anything our husbands don’t know about we\r\nfeel guilty.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can’t say I’ve been immaculately good,” gently protested\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, a little uncomfortable at this fresh example of\r\nsuccessful leaping at conclusions, for she had not said a word about\r\nher feeling of guilt.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I’m sure you have—I _see_ you being good—and that’s why you’re\r\nnot happy.”\r\n\r\n“She shouldn’t say things like that,” thought Mrs. Arbuthnot. “I must\r\ntry and help her not to.”\r\n\r\nAloud she said gravely, “I don’t know why you insist that I’m not\r\nhappy. When you know me better I think you’ll find that I am. And I’m\r\nsure you don’t mean really that goodness, if one could attain it, makes\r\none unhappy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do,” said Mrs. Wilkins. “Our sort of goodness does. We have\r\nattained it, and we are unhappy. There are miserable sorts of goodness\r\nand happy sorts—the sort we’ll have at the mediaeval castle, for\r\ninstance, is the happy sort.”\r\n\r\n“That is, supposing we go there,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot restrainingly.\r\nShe felt that Mrs. Wilkins needed holding on to. “After all, we’ve only\r\nwritten just to ask. Anybody may do that. I think it quite likely we\r\nshall find the conditions impossible, and even if they were not,\r\nprobably by to-morrow we shall not want to go.”\r\n\r\n“I _see_ us there,” was Mrs. Wilkins’s answer to that.\r\n\r\nAll this was very unbalancing. Mrs. Arbuthnot, as she presently\r\nsplashed through the dripping streets on her way to a meeting she\r\nwas to speak at, was in an unusually disturbed condition of mind.\r\nShe had, she hoped, shown herself very calm to Mrs. Wilkins, very\r\npractical and sober, concealing her own excitement. But she was really\r\nextraordinarily moved, and she felt happy, and she felt guilty, and\r\nshe felt afraid, and she had all the feelings, though this she did\r\nnot know, of a woman who has come away from a secret meeting with\r\nher lover. That, indeed, was what she looked like when she arrived\r\nlate on her platform; she, the open-browed, looked almost furtive as\r\nher eyes fell on the staring wooden faces waiting to hear her try\r\nand persuade them to contribute to the alleviation of the urgent\r\nneeds of the Hampstead poor, each one convinced that they needed\r\ncontributions themselves. She looked as though she were hiding\r\nsomething discreditable but delightful. Certainly her customary clear\r\nexpression of candour was not there, and its place was taken by a\r\nkind of suppressed and frightened pleasedness, which would have led a\r\nmore worldly-minded audience to the instant conviction of recent and\r\nprobably impassioned lovemaking.\r\n\r\nBeauty, beauty, beauty . . . the words kept ringing in her ears as she\r\nstood on the platform talking of sad things to the sparsely attended\r\nmeeting. She had never been to Italy. Was that really what her nest-egg\r\nwas to be spent on after all? Though she couldn’t approve of the way\r\nMrs. Wilkins was introducing the idea of predestination into her\r\nimmediate future, just as if she had no choice, just as if to struggle,\r\nor even to reflect, were useless, it yet influenced her. Mrs. Wilkins’s\r\neyes had been the eyes of a seer. Some people were like that, Mrs.\r\nArbuthnot knew; and if Mrs. Wilkins had actually seen her at the\r\nmediaeval castle it did seem probable that struggling would be a waste\r\nof time. Still, to spend her nest-egg on self-indulgence— The origin of\r\nthis egg had been corrupt, but she had at least supposed its end was to\r\nbe creditable. Was she to deflect it from its intended destination,\r\nwhich alone had appeared to justify her keeping it, and spend it on\r\ngiving herself pleasure?\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot spoke on and on, so much practised in the kind of speech\r\nthat she could have said it all in her sleep, and at the end of the\r\nmeeting, her eyes dazzled by her secret visions, she hardly noticed\r\nthat nobody was moved in any way whatever, least of all in the way of\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nBut the vicar noticed. The vicar was disappointed. Usually his good\r\nfriend and supporter Mrs. Arbuthnot succeeded better than this. And,\r\nwhat was even more unusual, she appeared, he observed, not even to\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine,” he said to her as they parted, speaking irritably,\r\nfor he was irritated both by the audience and by her, “what these\r\npeople are coming to. _Nothing_ seems to move them.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they need a holiday,” suggested Mrs. Arbuthnot; an\r\nunsatisfactory, a queer reply, the vicar thought.\r\n\r\n“In February?” he called after her sarcastically.\r\n\r\n“Oh no—not till April,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Very odd,” thought the vicar. “Very odd indeed.” And he went home and\r\nwas not perhaps quite christian to his wife.\r\n\r\nThat night in her prayers Mrs. Arbuthnot asked for guidance. She felt\r\nshe ought really to ask, straight out and roundly, that the mediaeval\r\ncastle should already have been taken by some one else and the whole\r\nthing thus be settled, but her courage failed her. Suppose her prayer\r\nwere to be answered? No; she couldn’t ask it; she couldn’t risk it. And\r\nafter all—she almost pointed this out to God—if she spent her present\r\nnest-egg on a holiday she could quite soon accumulate another.\r\nFrederick pressed money on her; and it would only mean, while she\r\nrolled up a second egg, that for a time her contributions to the parish\r\ncharities would be less. And then it could be the next nest-egg whose\r\noriginal corruption would be purged away by the use to which it was\r\nfinally put.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Arbuthnot, who had no money of her own, was obliged to live\r\non the proceeds of Frederick’s activities, and her very nest-egg was\r\nthe fruit, posthumously ripened, of ancient sin. The way Frederick made\r\nhis living was one of the standing distresses of her life. He wrote\r\nimmensely popular memoirs, regularly, every year, of the mistresses of\r\nkings. There were in history numerous kings who had had mistresses,\r\nand there were still more numerous mistresses who had had kings; so\r\nthat he had been able to publish a book of memoirs during each year of\r\nhis married life, and even so there were great further piles of these\r\nladies waiting to be dealt with. Mrs. Arbuthnot was helpless. Whether\r\nshe liked it or not, she was obliged to live on the proceeds. He gave\r\nher a dreadful sofa once, after the success of his Du Barri memoir,\r\nwith swollen cushions and soft, receptive lap, and it seemed to her\r\na miserable thing that there, in her very home, should flaunt this\r\nre-incarnation of a dead old French sinner.\r\n\r\nSimply good, convinced that morality is the basis of happiness, the\r\nfact that she and Frederick should draw their sustenance from guilt,\r\nhowever much purged by the passage of centuries, was one of the secret\r\nreasons of her sadness. The more the memoired lady had forgotten\r\nherself, the more his book about her was read and the more free-handed\r\nhe was to his wife; and all that he gave her was spent, after adding\r\nslightly to her nest-egg—for she did hope and believe that some day\r\npeople would cease to want to read of wickedness, and then Frederick\r\nwould need supporting—on helping the poor. The parish flourished\r\nbecause, to take a handful at random, of the ill-behaviour of the\r\nladies Du Barri, Montespan, Pompadour, Ninon de l’Enclos, and even of\r\nlearned Maintenon. The poor were the filter through which the money\r\nwas passed, to come out, Mrs. Arbuthnot hoped, purified. She could do\r\nno more. She had tried in days gone by to think the situation out, to\r\ndiscover the exact right course for her to take, but had found it, as\r\nshe had found Frederick, too difficult, and had left it, as she had\r\nleft Frederick, to God. Nothing of this money was spent on her house\r\nor dress; those remained, except for the great soft sofa, austere. It\r\nwas the poor who profited. Their very boots were stout with sins. But\r\nhow difficult it had been. Mrs. Arbuthnot, groping for guidance, prayed\r\nabout it to exhaustion. Ought she perhaps to refuse to touch the money,\r\nto avoid it as she would have avoided the sins which were its source?\r\nBut then what about the parish’s boots? She asked the vicar what he\r\nthought, and, through much delicate language, evasive and cautious, it\r\ndid finally appear that he was for the boots.\r\n\r\nAt least she had persuaded Frederick, when first he began his terrible\r\nsuccessful career—he only began it after their marriage; when she\r\nmarried him he had been a blameless official attached to the library of\r\nthe British Museum—to publish the memoirs under another name, so that\r\nshe was not publicly branded. Hampstead read the books with glee, and\r\nhad no idea that their writer lived in its midst. Frederick was almost\r\nunknown, even by sight, in Hampstead. He never went to any of its\r\ngatherings. Whatever it was he did in the way of recreation was done in\r\nLondon, but he never spoke of what he did or whom he saw; he might have\r\nbeen perfectly friendless for any mention he ever made of friends to\r\nhis wife. Only the vicar knew where the money for the parish came from,\r\nand he regarded it, he told Mrs. Arbuthnot, as a matter of honour not\r\nto mention it.\r\n\r\nAnd at least her little house was not haunted by the loose-lived\r\nladies, for Frederick did his work away from home. He had two rooms\r\nnear the British Museum, which was the scene of his exhumations, and\r\nthere he went every morning, and he came back long after his wife was\r\nasleep. Sometimes he did not come back at all. Sometimes she did not\r\nsee him for several days together. Then he would suddenly appear at\r\nbreakfast, having let himself in with his latchkey the night before,\r\nvery jovial and good-natured and free-handed and glad if she would\r\nallow him to give her something—a well-fed man, contented with the\r\nworld; a jolly, full-blooded, satisfied man. And she was always gentle,\r\nand anxious that his coffee should be as he liked it.\r\n\r\nHe seemed very happy. Life, she often thought, however much one\r\ntabulated was yet a mystery. There were always some people it was\r\nimpossible to place. Frederick was one of them. He didn’t seem to bear\r\nthe remotest resemblance to the original Frederick. He didn’t seem to\r\nhave the least need of any of the things he used to say were so\r\nimportant and beautiful—love, home, complete communion of thoughts,\r\ncomplete immersion in each other’s interests. After those early painful\r\nattempts to hold him up to the point from which they had hand in hand\r\nso splendidly started, attempts in which she herself had got terribly\r\nhurt and the Frederick she supposed she had married was mangled out of\r\nrecognition, she hung him up finally by her bedside as the chief\r\nsubject of her prayers, and left him, except for those, entirely to\r\nGod. She had loved Frederick too deeply to be able now to do anything\r\nbut pray for him. He had no idea that he never went out of the house\r\nwithout her blessing going with him too, hovering, like a little echo\r\nof finished love, round that once dear head. She didn’t dare think of\r\nhim as he used to be, as he had seemed to her to be in those marvellous\r\nfirst days of their love-making, of their marriage. Her child had died;\r\nshe had nothing, nobody of her own to lavish herself on. The poor\r\nbecame her children, and God the object of her love. What could be\r\nhappier than such a life, she sometimes asked herself; but her face,\r\nand particularly her eyes, continued sad.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps when we’re old . . . perhaps when we are both quite old . . .”\r\nshe would think wistfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\n\r\nThe owner of the mediaeval castle was an Englishman, a Mr. Briggs, who\r\nwas in London at the moment and wrote that it had beds enough for eight\r\npeople, exclusive of servants, three sitting-rooms, battlements,\r\ndungeons, and electric light. The rent was £60 for the month, the\r\nservants’ wages were extra, and he wanted references—he wanted\r\nassurances that the second half of his rent would be paid, the first\r\nhalf being paid in advance, and he wanted assurances of respectability\r\nfrom a solicitor, or a doctor, or a clergyman. He was very polite in\r\nhis letter, explaining that his desire for references was what was\r\nusual and should be regarded as a mere formality.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot and Mrs. Wilkins had not thought of references, and they\r\nhad not dreamed a rent could be so high. In their minds had floated\r\nsums like three guineas a week; or less, seeing that the place was\r\nsmall and old.\r\n\r\nSixty pounds for a single month.\r\n\r\nIt staggered them.\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. Arbuthnot’s eyes rose up boots: endless vistas, all the\r\nstout boots that sixty pounds would buy; and besides the rent there\r\nwould be the servants’ wages, and the food, and the railway journeys\r\nout and home. While as for references, these did indeed seem a\r\nstumbling-block; it did seem impossible to give any without making\r\ntheir plan more public than they had intended.\r\n\r\nThey had both—even Mrs. Arbuthnot, lured for once away from perfect\r\ncandour by the realisation of the great saving of trouble and criticism\r\nan imperfect explanation would produce—they had both thought it would\r\nbe a good plan to give out, each to her own circle, their circles being\r\nluckily distinct, that each was going to stay with a friend who had a\r\nhouse in Italy. It would be true as far as it went—Mrs. Wilkins\r\nasserted that it would be quite true, but Mrs. Arbuthnot thought it\r\nwouldn’t be quite—and it was the only way, Mrs. Wilkins said, to keep\r\nMellersh even approximately quiet. To spend any of her money just on\r\nthe mere getting to Italy would cause him indignation; what he would\r\nsay if he knew she was renting part of a mediaeval castle on her own\r\naccount Mrs. Wilkins preferred not to think. It would take him days to\r\nsay it all; and this although it was her very own money, and not a\r\npenny of it had ever been his.\r\n\r\n“But I expect,” she said, “your husband is just the same. I expect all\r\nhusbands are alike in the long run.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot said nothing, because her reason for not wanting\r\nFrederick to know was the exactly opposite one—Frederick would be only\r\ntoo pleased for her to go, he would not mind it in the very least;\r\nindeed, he would hail such a manifestation of self-indulgence and\r\nworldliness with an amusement that would hurt, and urge her to have a\r\ngood time and not to hurry home with a crushing detachment. Far better,\r\nshe thought, to be missed by Mellersh than to be sped by Frederick. To\r\nbe missed, to be needed, from whatever motive, was, she thought, better\r\nthan the complete loneliness of not being missed or needed at all.\r\n\r\nShe therefore said nothing, and allowed Mrs. Wilkins to leap at her\r\nconclusions unchecked. But they did, both of them, for a whole day feel\r\nthat the only thing to be done was to renounce the mediaeval castle;\r\nand it was in arriving at this bitter decision that they really\r\nrealised how acute had been their longing for it.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Arbuthnot, whose mind was trained in the finding of ways out\r\nof difficulties, found a way out of the reference difficulty; and\r\nsimultaneously Mrs. Wilkins had a vision revealing to her how to reduce\r\nthe rent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot’s plan was simple, and completely successful. She took\r\nthe whole of the rent in person to the owner, drawing it out of her\r\nSavings Bank—again she looked furtive and apologetic, as if the clerk\r\nmust know the money was wanted for purposes of self-indulgence—and,\r\ngoing up with the six ten pound notes in her hand-bag to the address\r\nnear the Brompton Oratory where the owner lived, presented them to him,\r\nwaiving her right to pay only half. And when he saw her, and her parted\r\nhair and soft dark eyes and sober apparel, and heard her grave voice,\r\nhe told her not to bother about writing round for those references.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be all right,” he said, scribbling a receipt for the rent. “Do\r\nsit down, won’t you? Nasty day, isn’t it? You’ll find the old castle\r\nhas lots of sunshine, whatever else it hasn’t got. Husband going?”\r\n\r\nMrs. Arbuthnot, unused to anything but candour, looked troubled at this\r\nquestion and began to murmur inarticulately, and the owner at once\r\nconcluded that she was a widow—a war one, of course, for other widows\r\nwere old—and that he had been a fool not to guess it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” he said, turning red right up to his fair hair. “I\r\ndidn’t mean—h’m, h’m, h’m—”\r\n\r\nHe ran his eye over the receipt he had written. “Yes, I think that’s\r\nall right,” he said, getting up and giving it to her. “Now,” he added,\r\ntaking the six notes she held out and smiling, for Mrs. Arbuthnot was\r\nagreeable to look at, “I’m richer, and you’re happier. I’ve got money,\r\nand you’ve got San Salvatore. I wonder which is best.”\r\n\r\n“I think you know,” said Mrs. Arbuthnot with her sweet smile."

Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, writing to her\r\ndaughter, the Countess of Bute, over a year later [January 1st, 1755],\r\nremarked that “my friend Smollett . . . has certainly a talent for\r\ninvention, though I think it flags a little in his last work.” Lady\r\nMary was both right and wrong. The inventive power which we commonly\r\nthink of as Smollett’s was the ability to work over his own experience\r\ninto realistic fiction. Of this, Ferdinand Count Fathom shows\r\ncomparatively little. It shows relatively little, too, of Smollett’s\r\nvigorous personality, which in his earlier works was present to give\r\nlife and interest to almost every chapter, were it to describe a street\r\nbrawl, a ludicrous situation, a whimsical character, or with venomous\r\nprejudice to gibbet some enemy. This individuality—the peculiar spirit\r\nof the author which can be felt rather than described—is present in the\r\ndedication of Fathom to Doctor ———, who is no other than Smollett\r\nhimself, and a candid revelation of his character, by the way, this\r\ndedication contains. It is present, too, in the opening chapters, which\r\nshow, likewise, in the picture of Fathom’s mother, something of the\r\nauthor’s peculiar “talent for invention.” Subsequently, however, there\r\nis no denying that the Smollett invention and the Smollett spirit both\r\nflag. And yet, in a way, Fathom displays more invention than any of the\r\nauthor’s novels; it is based far less than any other on personal\r\nexperience. Unfortunately such thorough-going invention was not suited\r\nto Smollett’s genius. The result is, that while uninteresting as a\r\nnovel of contemporary manners, Fathom has an interest of its own in\r\nthat it reveals a new side of its author. We think of Smollett,\r\ngenerally, as a rambling storyteller, a rational, unromantic man of the\r\nworld, who fills his pages with his own oddly-metamorphosed\r\nacquaintances and experiences. The Smollett of Count Fathom, on the\r\ncontrary, is rather a forerunner of the romantic school, who has\r\ncreated a tolerably organic tale of adventure out of his own brain.\r\nThough this is notably less readable than the author’s earlier works,\r\nstill the wonder is that when the man is so far “off his beat,” he\r\nshould yet know so well how to meet the strange conditions which\r\nconfront him. To one whose idea of Smollett’s genius is formed entirely\r\nby Random and Pickle and Humphry Clinker, Ferdinand Count Fathom will\r\noffer many surprises.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the comparative lifelessness of the book. True,\r\nhere again are action and incident galore, but generally unaccompanied\r\nby that rough Georgian hurly-burly, common in Smollett, which is so\r\ninteresting to contemplate from a comfortable distance, and which goes\r\nso far towards making his fiction seem real. Nor are the characters,\r\nfor the most part, life-like enough to be interesting. There is an\r\napparent exception, to be sure, in the hero’s mother, already\r\nmentioned, the hardened camp-follower, whom we confidently expect to\r\nbecome vitalised after the savage fashion of Smollett’s characters.\r\nBut, alas! we have no chance to learn the lady’s style of conversation,\r\nfor the few words that come from her lips are but partially\r\ncharacteristic; we have only too little chance to learn her manners and\r\ncustoms. In the fourth chapter, while she is making sure with her\r\ndagger that all those on the field of battle whom she wishes to rifle\r\nare really dead, an officer of the hussars, who has been watching her\r\nlucrative progress, unfeelingly puts a brace of bullets into the lady’s\r\nbrain, just as she raises her hand to smite him to the heart. Perhaps\r\nit is as well that she is thus removed before our disappointment at the\r\nnon-fulfilment of her promise becomes poignant. So far as we may judge\r\nfrom the other personages of Count Fathom, even this interesting Amazon\r\nwould sooner or later have turned into a wooden figure, with a label\r\ngiving the necessary information as to her character.\r\n\r\nSuch certainly is her son, Fathom, the hero of the book. Because he is\r\nplacarded, “Shrewd villain of monstrous inhumanity,” we are fain to\r\naccept him for what his creator intended; but seldom in word or deed is\r\nhe a convincingly real villain. His friend and foil, the noble young\r\nCount de Melvil, is no more alive than he; and equally wooden are\r\nJoshua, the high-minded, saint-like Jew, and that tedious, foolish Don\r\nDiego. Neither is the heroine alive, the peerless Monimia, but then, in\r\nher case, want of vitality is not surprising; the presence of it would\r\namaze us. If she were a woman throbbing with life, she would be\r\ndifferent from Smollett’s other heroines. The “second lady” of the\r\nmelodrama, Mademoiselle de Melvil, though by no means vivified, is yet\r\nmore real than her sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they are mostly inanimate figures is not the only\r\nsurprise given us by the personages of Count Fathom. It is a surprise\r\nto find few of them strikingly whimsical; it is a surprise to find them\r\nin some cases far more distinctly conceived than any of the people in\r\nRoderick Random or Peregrine Pickle. In the second of these, we saw\r\nSmollett beginning to understand the use of incident to indicate\r\nconsistent development of character. In Count Fathom, he seems fully to\r\nunderstand this principle of art, though he has not learned to apply it\r\nsuccessfully. And so, in spite of an excellent conception, Fathom, as I\r\nhave said, is unreal. After all his villainies, which he perpetrates\r\nwithout any apparent qualms of conscience, it is incredible that he\r\nshould honestly repent of his crimes. We are much inclined to doubt\r\nwhen we read that “his vice and ambition was now quite mortified within\r\nhim,” the subsequent testimony of Matthew Bramble, Esq., in Humphry\r\nClinker, to the contrary, notwithstanding. Yet Fathom up to this point\r\nis consistently drawn, and drawn for a purpose:—to show that\r\ncold-blooded roguery, though successful for a while, will come to grief\r\nin the end. To heighten the effect of his scoundrel, Smollett develops\r\nparallel with him the virtuous Count de Melvil. The author’s scheme of\r\nthus using one character as the foil of another, though not conspicuous\r\nfor its originality, shows a decided advance in the theory of\r\nconstructive technique. Only, as I have said, Smollett’s execution is\r\nnow defective.\r\n\r\n“But,” one will naturally ask, “if Fathom lacks the amusing, and not\r\ninfrequently stimulating, hurly-burly of Smollett’s former novels; if\r\nits characters, though well-conceived, are seldom divertingly fantastic\r\nand never thoroughly animate; what makes the book interesting?” The\r\nsurprise will be greater than ever when the answer is given that, to a\r\nlarge extent, the plot makes Fathom interesting. Yes, Smollett,\r\nhitherto indifferent to structure, has here written a story in which\r\nthe plot itself, often clumsy though it may be, engages a reader’s\r\nattention. One actually wants to know whether the young Count is ever\r\ngoing to receive consolation for his sorrows and inflict justice on his\r\nbasely ungrateful pensioner. And when, finally, all turns out as it\r\nshould, one is amazed to find how many of the people in the book have\r\nhelped towards the designed conclusion. Not all of them, indeed, nor\r\nall of the adventures, are indispensable, but it is manifest at the end\r\nthat much, which, for the time, most readers think irrelevant—such as\r\nDon Diego’s history—is, after all, essential.\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that in Count Fathom Smollett appears to some\r\nextent as a romanticist, and this is another fact which lends interest\r\nto the book. That he had a powerful imagination is not a surprise. Any\r\none versed in Smollett has already seen it in the remarkable situations\r\nwhich he has put before us in his earlier works. These do not indicate,\r\nhowever, that Smollett possessed the imagination which could excite\r\nromantic interest; for in Roderick Random and in Peregrine Pickle, the\r\nwonderful situations serve chiefly to amuse. In Fathom, however, there\r\nare some designed to excite horror; and one, at least, is eminently\r\nsuccessful. The hero’s night in the wood between Bar-le-duc and Chalons\r\nwas no doubt more blood-curdling to our eighteenth-century ancestors\r\nthan it is to us, who have become acquainted with scores of similar\r\nsituations in the small number of exciting romances which belong to\r\nliterature, and in the greater number which do not. Still, even to-day,\r\na reader, with his taste jaded by trashy novels, will be conscious of\r\nSmollett’s power, and of several thrills, likewise, as he reads about\r\nFathom’s experience in the loft in which the beldame locks him to pass\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nThis situation is melodramatic rather than romantic, as the word is\r\nused technically in application to eighteenth and nineteenth-century\r\nliterature. There is no little in Fathom, however, which is genuinely\r\nromantic in the latter sense. Such is the imprisonment of the Countess\r\nin the castle-tower, whence she waves her handkerchief to the young\r\nCount, her son and would-be rescuer. And especially so is the scene in\r\nthe church, when Renaldo (the very name is romantic) visits at midnight\r\nthe supposed grave of his lady-love. While he was waiting for the\r\nsexton to open the door, his “soul . . . was wound up to the highest\r\npitch of enthusiastic sorrow. The uncommon darkness, . . . the solemn\r\nsilence, and lonely situation of the place, conspired with the occasion\r\nof his coming, and the dismal images of his fancy, to produce a real\r\nrapture of gloomy expectation, which the whole world could not have\r\npersuaded him to disappoint. The clock struck twelve, the owl screeched\r\nfrom the ruined battlement, the door was opened by the sexton, who, by\r\nthe light of a glimmering taper, conducted the despairing lover to a\r\ndreary aisle, and stamped upon the ground with his foot, saying, ‘Here\r\nthe young lady lies interred.’”\r\n\r\nWe have here such an amount of the usual romantic machinery of the\r\n“grave-yard” school of poets—that school of which Professor W. L.\r\nPhelps calls Young, in his Night Thoughts, the most “conspicuous\r\nexemplar”—that one is at first inclined to think Smollett poking fun at\r\nit. The context, however, seems to prove that he was perfectly serious.\r\nIt is interesting, then, as well as surprising, to find traces of the\r\nromantic spirit in his fiction over ten years before Walpole’s Castle\r\nof Otranto. It is also interesting to find so much melodramatic feeling\r\nin him, because it makes stronger the connection between him and his\r\nnineteenth-century disciple, Dickens.\r\n\r\nFrom all that I have said, it must not be thought that the usual\r\nSmollett is always, or almost always, absent from Count Fathom. I have\r\nspoken of the dedication and of the opening chapters as what we might\r\nexpect from his pen. There are, besides, true Smollett strokes in the\r\nscenes in the prison from which Melvil rescues Fathom, and there is a\r\ngood deal of the satirical Smollett fun in the description of Fathom’s\r\nups and downs, first as the petted beau, and then as the fashionable\r\ndoctor. In chronicling the latter meteoric career, Smollett had already\r\nobserved the peculiarity of his countrymen which Thackeray was fond of\r\nharping on in the next century—“the maxim which universally prevails\r\namong the English people . . . to overlook, . . . on their return to\r\nthe metropolis, all the connexions they may have chanced to acquire\r\nduring their residence at any of the medical wells. And this social\r\ndisposition is so scrupulously maintained, that two persons who live in\r\nthe most intimate correspondence at Bath or Tunbridge, shall, in\r\nfour-and-twenty hours . . . meet in St. James’s Park, without betraying\r\nthe least token of recognition.” And good, too, is the way in which, as\r\nDr. Fathom goes rapidly down the social hill, he makes excuses for his\r\ndeclining splendour. His chariot was overturned “with a hideous crash”\r\nat such danger to himself, “that he did not believe he should ever\r\nhazard himself again in any sort of wheel carriage.” He turned off his\r\nmen for maids, because “men servants are generally impudent, lazy,\r\ndebauched, or dishonest.” To avoid the din of the street, he shifted\r\nhis lodgings into a quiet, obscure court. And so forth and so on, in\r\nthe true Smollett vein.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, such of the old sparks are struck only occasionally.\r\nApart from its plot, which not a few nineteenth-century writers of\r\ndetective-stories might have improved, The Adventures of Ferdinand\r\nCount Fathom is less interesting for itself than any other piece of\r\nfiction from Smollett’s pen. For a student of Smollett, however, it is\r\nhighly interesting as showing the author’s romantic, melodramatic\r\ntendencies, and the growth of his constructive technique.\r\n\r\nG. H. MAYNADIER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF FERDINAND COUNT FATHOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR ———\r\n\r\n\r\nYou and I, my good friend, have often deliberated on the difficulty of\r\nwriting such a dedication as might gratify the self-complacency of a\r\npatron, without exposing the author to the ridicule or censure of the\r\npublic; and I think we generally agreed that the task was altogether\r\nimpracticable.—Indeed, this was one of the few subjects on which we\r\nhave always thought in the same manner. For, notwithstanding that\r\ndeference and regard which we mutually pay to each other, certain it\r\nis, we have often differed, according to the predominancy of those\r\ndifferent passions, which frequently warp the opinion, and perplex the\r\nunderstanding of the most judicious.\r\n\r\nIn dedication, as in poetry, there is no medium; for, if any one of the\r\nhuman virtues be omitted in the enumeration of the patron’s good\r\nqualities, the whole address is construed into an affront, and the\r\nwriter has the mortification to find his praise prostituted to very\r\nlittle purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should he yield to the transports of gratitude or\r\naffection, which is always apt to exaggerate, and produce no more than\r\nthe genuine effusions of his heart, the world will make no allowance\r\nfor the warmth of his passion, but ascribe the praise he bestows to\r\ninterested views and sordid adulation.\r\n\r\nSometimes too, dazzled by the tinsel of a character which he has no\r\nopportunity to investigate, he pours forth the homage of his admiration\r\nupon some false Maecenas, whose future conduct gives the lie to his\r\neulogium, and involves him in shame and confusion of face. Such was the\r\nfate of a late ingenious author [the Author of the “Seasons”], who was\r\nso often put to the blush for the undeserved incense he had offered in\r\nthe heat of an enthusiastic disposition, misled by popular applause,\r\nthat he had resolved to retract, in his last will, all the encomiums\r\nwhich he had thus prematurely bestowed, and stigmatise the unworthy by\r\nname—a laudable scheme of poetical justice, the execution of which was\r\nfatally prevented by untimely death.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the fate of other dedicators, I, for my own\r\npart, sit down to write this address, without any apprehension of\r\ndisgrace or disappointment; because I know you are too well convinced\r\nof my affection and sincerity to repine at what I shall say touching\r\nyour character and conduct. And you will do me the justice to believe,\r\nthat this public distinction is a testimony of my particular friendship\r\nand esteem.\r\n\r\nNot that I am either insensible of your infirmities, or disposed to\r\nconceal them from the notice of mankind. There are certain foibles\r\nwhich can only be cured by shame and mortification; and whether or not\r\nyours be of that species, I shall have the comfort to think my best\r\nendeavours were used for your reformation.\r\n\r\nKnow then, I can despise your pride, while I honour your integrity, and\r\napplaud your taste, while I am shocked at your ostentation.—I have\r\nknown you trifling, superficial, and obstinate in dispute; meanly\r\njealous and awkwardly reserved; rash and haughty in your resentments;\r\nand coarse and lowly in your connexions. I have blushed at the weakness\r\nof your conversation, and trembled at the errors of your conduct—yet,\r\nas I own you possess certain good qualities, which overbalance these\r\ndefects, and distinguish you on this occasion as a person for whom I\r\nhave the most perfect attachment and esteem, you have no cause to\r\ncomplain of the indelicacy with which your faults are reprehended. And\r\nas they are chiefly the excesses of a sanguine disposition and\r\nlooseness of thought, impatient of caution or control, you may, thus\r\nstimulated, watch over your own intemperance and infirmity with\r\nredoubled vigilance and consideration, and for the future profit by the\r\nseverity of my reproof.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are not the only motives that induce me to trouble you\r\nwith this public application. I must not only perform my duty to my\r\nfriends, but also discharge the debt I owe to my own interest. We live\r\nin a censorious age; and an author cannot take too much precaution to\r\nanticipate the prejudice, misapprehension, and temerity of malice,\r\nignorance, and presumption.\r\n\r\nI therefore think it incumbent upon me to give some previous intimation\r\nof the plan which I have executed in the subsequent performance, that I\r\nmay not be condemned upon partial evidence; and to whom can I with more\r\npropriety appeal in my explanation than to you, who are so well\r\nacquainted with all the sentiments and emotions of my breast?\r\n\r\nA novel is a large diffused picture, comprehending the characters of\r\nlife, disposed in different groups, and exhibited in various attitudes,\r\nfor the purposes of an uniform plan, and general occurrence, to which\r\nevery individual figure is subservient. But this plan cannot be\r\nexecuted with propriety, probability, or success, without a principal\r\npersonage to attract the attention, unite the incidents, unwind the\r\nclue of the labyrinth, and at last close the scene, by virtue of his\r\nown importance.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the heroes of this kind, who have hitherto succeeded on the\r\nEnglish stage, are characters of transcendent worth, conducted through\r\nthe vicissitudes of fortune, to that goal of happiness, which ever\r\nought to be the repose of extraordinary desert.—Yet the same principle\r\nby which we rejoice at the remuneration of merit, will teach us to\r\nrelish the disgrace and discomfiture of vice, which is always an\r\nexample of extensive use and influence, because it leaves a deep\r\nimpression of terror upon the minds of those who were not confirmed in\r\nthe pursuit of morality and virtue, and, while the balance wavers,\r\nenables the right scale to preponderate.\r\n\r\nIn the drama, which is a more limited field of invention, the chief\r\npersonage is often the object of our detestation and abhorrence; and we\r\nare as well pleased to see the wicked schemes of a Richard blasted, and\r\nthe perfidy of a Maskwell exposed, as to behold a Bevil happy, and an\r\nEdward victorious.\r\n\r\nThe impulses of fear, which is the most violent and interesting of all\r\nthe passions, remain longer than any other upon the memory; and for one\r\nthat is allured to virtue, by the contemplation of that peace and\r\nhappiness which it bestows, a hundred are deterred from the practice of\r\nvice, by that infamy and punishment to which it is liable, from the\r\nlaws and regulations of mankind.\r\n\r\nLet me not, therefore, be condemned for having chosen my principal\r\ncharacter from the purlieus of treachery and fraud, when I declare my\r\npurpose is to set him up as a beacon for the benefit of the\r\nunexperienced and unwary, who, from the perusal of these memoirs, may\r\nlearn to avoid the manifold snares with which they are continually\r\nsurrounded in the paths of life; while those who hesitate on the brink\r\nof iniquity may be terrified from plunging into that irremediable gulf,\r\nby surveying the deplorable fate of Ferdinand Count Fathom.\r\n\r\nThat the mind might not be fatigued, nor the imagination disgusted, by\r\na succession of vicious objects, I have endeavoured to refresh the\r\nattention with occasional incidents of a different nature; and raised\r\nup a virtuous character, in opposition to the adventurer, with a view\r\nto amuse the fancy, engage the affection, and form a striking contrast\r\nwhich might heighten the expression, and give a relief to the moral of\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIf I have not succeeded in my endeavours to unfold the mysteries of\r\nfraud, to instruct the ignorant, and entertain the vacant; if I have\r\nfailed in my attempts to subject folly to ridicule, and vice to\r\nindignation; to rouse the spirit of mirth, wake the soul of compassion,\r\nand touch the secret springs that move the heart; I have, at least,\r\nadorned virtue with honour and applause, branded iniquity with reproach\r\nand shame, and carefully avoided every hint or expression which could\r\ngive umbrage to the most delicate reader—circumstances which (whatever\r\nmay be my fate with the public) will with you always operate in favour\r\nof,\r\n\r\nDear sir, your very affectionate friend and servant,\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE\r\n\r\nSOME SAGE OBSERVATIONS THAT NATURALLY INTRODUCE OUR IMPORTANT HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCardinal de Retz very judiciously observes, that all historians must of\r\nnecessity be subject to mistakes, in explaining the motives of those\r\nactions they record, unless they derive their intelligence from the\r\ncandid confession of the person whose character they represent; and\r\nthat, of consequence, every man of importance ought to write his own\r\nmemoirs, provided he has honesty enough to tell the truth, without\r\nsuppressing any circumstance that may tend to the information of the\r\nreader. This, however, is a requisite that, I am afraid, would be very\r\nrarely found among the number of those who exhibit their own portraits\r\nto the public. Indeed, I will venture to say, that, how upright soever\r\na man’s intentions may be, he will, in the performance of such a task,\r\nbe sometimes misled by his own phantasy, and represent objects, as they\r\nappeared to him, through the mists of prejudice and passion.\r\n\r\nAn unconcerned reader, when he peruses the history of two competitors,\r\nwho lived two thousand years ago, or who perhaps never had existence,\r\nexcept in the imagination of the author, cannot help interesting\r\nhimself in the dispute, and espousing one side of the contest, with all\r\nthe zeal of a warm adherent. What wonder, then, that we should be\r\nheated in our own concerns, review our actions with the same\r\nself-approbation that they had formerly acquired, and recommend them to\r\nthe world with all the enthusiasm of paternal affection?\r\n\r\nSupposing this to be the case, it was lucky for the cause of historical\r\ntruth, that so many pens have been drawn by writers, who could not be\r\nsuspected of such partiality; and that many great personages, among the\r\nancients as well as moderns, either would not or could not entertain\r\nthe public with their own memoirs. From this want of inclination or\r\ncapacity to write, in our hero himself, the undertaking is now left to\r\nme, of transmitting to posterity the remarkable adventures of FERDINAND\r\nCOUNT FATHOM; and by the time the reader shall have glanced over the\r\nsubsequent sheets, I doubt not but he will bless God that the\r\nadventurer was not his own historian.\r\n\r\nThis mirror of modern chivalry was none of those who owe their dignity\r\nto the circumstances of their birth, and are consecrated from the\r\ncradle for the purposes of greatness, merely because they are the\r\naccidental children of wealth. He was heir to no visible patrimony,\r\nunless we reckon a robust constitution, a tolerable appearance, and an\r\nuncommon capacity, as the advantages of inheritance. If the comparison\r\nobtains in this point of consideration, he was as much as any man\r\nindebted to his parent; and pity it was, that, in the sequel of his\r\nfortune, he never had an opportunity of manifesting his filial\r\ngratitude and regard. From this agreeable act of duty to his sire, and\r\nall those tendernesses that are reciprocally enjoyed betwixt the father\r\nand the son, he was unhappily excluded by a small circumstance; at\r\nwhich, however, he was never heard to repine. In short, had he been\r\nbrought forth in the fabulous ages of the world, the nature of his\r\norigin might have turned to his account; he might, like other heroes of\r\nantiquity, have laid claim to divine extraction, without running the\r\nrisk of being claimed by an earthly father. Not that his parents had\r\nany reason to disown or renounce their offspring, or that there was\r\nanything preternatural in the circumstances of his generation and\r\nbirth; on the contrary, he was, from the beginning, a child of\r\npromising parts, and in due course of nature ushered into the world\r\namidst a whole cloud of witnesses. But, that he was acknowledged by no\r\nmortal sire, solely proceeded from the uncertainty of his mother, whose\r\naffections were so dissipated among a number of admirers, that she\r\ncould never pitch upon the person from whose loins our hero sprung.\r\n\r\nOver and above this important doubt under which he was begotten, other\r\nparticularities attended his birth, and seemed to mark him out as\r\nsomething uncommon among the sons of men. He was brought forth in a\r\nwaggon, and might be said to be literally a native of two different\r\ncountries; for, though he first saw the light in Holland, he was not\r\nborn till after the carriage arrived in Flanders; so that, all these\r\nextraordinary circumstances considered, the task of determining to what\r\ngovernment he naturally owed allegiance, would be at least as difficult\r\nas that of ascertaining the so much contested birthplace of Homer.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, the Count’s mother was an Englishwoman, who, after\r\nhaving been five times a widow in one campaign, was, in the last year\r\nof the renowned Marlborough’s command, numbered among the baggage of\r\nthe allied army, which she still accompanied, through pure benevolence\r\nof spirit, supplying the ranks with the refreshing streams of choice\r\nGeneva, and accommodating individuals with clean linen, as the\r\nemergency of their occasions required. Nor was her philanthropy\r\naltogether confined to such ministration; she abounded with “the milk\r\nof human kindness,” which flowed plentifully among her\r\nfellow-creatures; and to every son of Mars who cultivated her favour,\r\nshe liberally dispensed her smiles, in order to sweeten the toils and\r\ndangers of the field.\r\n\r\nAnd here it will not be amiss to anticipate the remarks of the reader,\r\nwho, in the chastity and excellency of his conception, may possibly\r\nexclaim, “Good Heaven! will these authors never reform their\r\nimaginations, and lift their ideas from the obscene objects of low\r\nlife? Must the public be again disgusted with the grovelling adventures\r\nof a waggon? Will no writer of genius draw his pen in the vindication\r\nof taste, and entertain us with the agreeable characters, the dignified\r\nconversation, the poignant repartee, in short, the genteel comedy of\r\nthe polite world?”\r\n\r\nHave a little patience, gentle, delicate, sublime critic; you, I doubt\r\nnot, are one of those consummate connoisseurs, who, in their\r\npurifications, let humour evaporate, while they endeavour to preserve\r\ndecorum, and polish wit, until the edge of it is quite worn off. Or,\r\nperhaps, of that class, who, in the sapience of taste, are disgusted\r\nwith those very flavours in the productions of their own country which\r\nhave yielded infinite delectation to their faculties, when imported\r\nfrom another clime; and d—n an author in despite of all precedent and\r\nprescription;—who extol the writings of Petronius Arbiter, read with\r\nrapture the amorous sallies of Ovid’s pen, and chuckle over the story\r\nof Lucian’s ass; yet, if a modern author presumes to relate the\r\nprogress of a simple intrigue, are shocked at the indecency and\r\nimmorality of the scene;—who delight in following Guzman d’Alfarache,\r\nthrough all the mazes of squalid beggary; who with pleasure accompany\r\nDon Quixote and his squire, in the lowest paths of fortune; who are\r\ndiverted with the adventures of Scarron’s ragged troop of strollers,\r\nand highly entertained with the servile situations of Gil Blas; yet,\r\nwhen a character in humble life occasionally occurs in a performance of\r\nour own growth, exclaim, with an air of disgust, “Was ever anything so\r\nmean! sure, this writer must have been very conversant with the lowest\r\nscenes of life;”—who, when Swift or Pope represents a coxcomb in the\r\nact of swearing, scruple not to laugh at the ridiculous execrations;\r\nbut, in a less reputed author, condemn the use of such profane\r\nexpletives;—who eagerly explore the jakes of Rabelais, for amusement,\r\nand even extract humour from the dean’s description of a lady’s\r\ndressing-room; yet in a production of these days, unstamped with such\r\nvenerable names, will stop their noses, with all the signs of loathing\r\nand abhorrence, at a bare mention of the china chamber-pot;—who\r\napplauded Catullus, Juvenal, Persius, and Lucan, for their spirit in\r\nlashing the greatest names of antiquity; yet, when a British satirist,\r\nof this generation, has courage enough to call in question the talents\r\nof a pseudo-patron in power, accuse him of insolence, rancour, and\r\nscurrility.\r\n\r\nIf such you be, courteous reader, I say again, have a little patience;\r\nfor your entertainment we are about to write. Our hero shall, with all\r\nconvenient despatch, be gradually sublimed into those splendid\r\nconnexions of which you are enamoured; and God forbid, that, in the\r\nmeantime, the nature of his extraction should turn to his prejudice in\r\na land of freedom like this, where individuals are every day ennobled\r\nin consequence of their own qualifications, without the least\r\nretrospective regard to the rank or merit of their ancestors. Yes,\r\nrefined reader, we are hastening to that goal of perfection, where\r\nsatire dares not show her face; where nature is castigated, almost even\r\nto still life; where humour turns changeling, and slavers in an insipid\r\ngrin; where wit is volatilised into a mere vapour; where decency,\r\ndivested of all substance, hovers about like a fantastic shadow; where\r\nthe salt of genius, escaping, leaves nothing but pure and simple\r\nphlegm; and the inoffensive pen for ever drops the mild manna of\r\nsoul-sweetening praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO\r\n\r\nA SUPERFICIAL VIEW OF OUR HERO’S INFANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus bespoken the indulgence of our guests, let us now produce\r\nthe particulars of our entertainment, and speedily conduct our\r\nadventurer through the stage of infancy, which seldom teems with\r\ninteresting incidents.\r\n\r\nAs the occupations of his mother would not conveniently permit her to\r\nsuckle this her firstborn at her own breast, and those happy ages were\r\nnow no more, in which the charge of nursing a child might be left to\r\nthe next goat or she-wolf, she resolved to improve upon the ordinances\r\nof nature, and foster him with a juice much more energetic than the\r\nmilk of goat, wolf, or woman; this was no other than that delicious\r\nnectar, which, as we have already hinted, she so cordially distributed\r\nfrom a small cask that hung before her, depending from her shoulders by\r\na leathern zone. Thus determined, ere he was yet twelve days old, she\r\nenclosed him in a canvas knapsack, which being adjusted to her neck,\r\nfell down upon her back, and balanced the cargo that rested on her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting those who affirm, that, while her double charge\r\nwas carried about in this situation, her keg was furnished with a long\r\nand slender flexible tube, which, when the child began to be clamorous,\r\nshe conveyed into his mouth, and straight he stilled himself with\r\nsucking; but this we consider as an extravagant assertion of those who\r\nmix the marvellous in all their narrations, because we cannot conceive\r\nhow the tender organs of an infant could digest such a fiery beverage,\r\nwhich never fails to discompose the constitutions of the most hardy and\r\nrobust. We therefore conclude that the use of this potation was more\r\nrestrained, and that it was with simple element diluted into a\r\ncomposition adapted to his taste and years. Be this as it will, he\r\ncertainly was indulged in the use of it to such a degree as would have\r\neffectually obstructed his future fortune, had not he been happily\r\ncloyed with the repetition of the same fare, for which he conceived the\r\nutmost detestation and abhorrence, rejecting it with loathing and\r\ndisgust, like those choice spirits, who, having been crammed with\r\nreligion in their childhood, renounce it in their youth, among other\r\nabsurd prejudices of education.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus dangled in a state of suspension, a German trooper\r\nwas transiently smit with the charms of his mother, who listened to his\r\nhonourable addresses, and once more received the silken bonds of\r\nmatrimony; the ceremony having been performed as usual at the\r\ndrum-head. The lady had no sooner taken possession of her new name,\r\nthan she bestowed it upon her son, who was thenceforward distinguished\r\nby the appellation of Ferdinand de Fadom; nor was the husband offended\r\nat this presumption in his wife, which he not only considered as a\r\nproof of her affection and esteem, but also as a compliment, by which\r\nhe might in time acquire the credit of being the real father of such a\r\nhopeful child.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this new engagement with a foreigner, our hero’s mother\r\nstill exercised the virtues of her calling among the English troops, so\r\nmuch was she biassed by that laudable partiality, which, as Horace\r\nobserves, the natale solum generally inspires. Indeed this inclination\r\nwas enforced by another reason, that did not fail to influence her\r\nconduct in this particular; all her knowledge of the High Dutch\r\nlanguage consisted in some words of traffic absolutely necessary for\r\nthe practice of hex vocation, together with sundry oaths and terms of\r\nreproach, that kept her customers in awe; so that, except among her own\r\ncountrymen, she could not indulge that propensity to conversation, for\r\nwhich she had been remarkable from her earliest years. Nor did this\r\ninstance of her affection fail of turning to her account in the sequel.\r\nShe was promoted to the office of cook to a regimental mess of\r\nofficers; and, before the peace of Utrecht, was actually in possession\r\nof a suttling-tent, pitched for the accommodation of the gentlemen in\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ferdinand improved apace in the accomplishments of infancy;\r\nhis beauty was conspicuous, and his vigour so uncommon, that he was\r\nwith justice likened unto Hercules in the cradle. The friends of his\r\nfather-in-law dandled him on their knees, while he played with their\r\nwhiskers, and, before he was thirteen months old, taught him to suck\r\nbrandy impregnated with gunpowder, through the touch-hole of a pistol.\r\nAt the same time, he was caressed by divers serjeants of the British\r\narmy, who severally and in secret contemplated his qualifications with\r\na father’s pride, excited by the artful declaration with which the\r\nmother had flattered each apart.\r\n\r\nSoon as the war was (for her unhappily) concluded, she, as in duty\r\nbound, followed her husband into Bohemia; and his regiment being sent\r\ninto garrison at Prague, she opened a cabaret in that city, which was\r\nfrequented by a good many guests of the Scotch and Irish nations, who\r\nwere devoted to the exercise of arms in the service of the Emperor. It\r\nwas by this communication that the English tongue became vernacular to\r\nyoung Ferdinand, who, without such opportunity, would have been a\r\nstranger to the language of his forefathers, in spite of all his\r\nmother’s loquacity and elocution; though it must be owned, for the\r\ncredit of her maternal care, that she let slip no occasion of making it\r\nfamiliar to his ear and conception; for, even at those intervals in\r\nwhich she could find no person to carry on the altercation, she used to\r\nhold forth in earnest soliloquies upon the subject of her own\r\nsituation, giving vent to many opprobrious invectives against her\r\nhusband’s country, between which and Old England she drew many odious\r\ncomparisons; and prayed, without ceasing, that Europe might speedily be\r\ninvolved in a general war, so as that she might have some chance of\r\nre-enjoying the pleasures and emoluments of a Flanders campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE\r\n\r\nHE IS INITIATED IN A MILITARY LIFE, AND HAS THE GOOD FORTUNE TO ACQUIRE\r\nA GENEROUS PATRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile she wearied Heaven with these petitions, the flame of war broke\r\nout betwixt the houses of Ottoman and Austria, and the Emperor sent\r\nforth an army into Hungary, under the auspices of the renowned Prince\r\nEugene. On account of this expedition, the mother of our hero gave up\r\nhousekeeping, and cheerfully followed her customers and husband into\r\nthe field; having first provided herself with store of those\r\ncommodities in which she had formerly merchandised. Although the hope\r\nof profit might in some measure affect her determination, one of the\r\nchief motives for her visiting the frontiers of Turkey, was the desire\r\nof initiating her son in the rudiments of his education, which she now\r\nthought high time to inculcate, he being, at this period, in the sixth\r\nyear of his age; he was accordingly conducted to the camp, which she\r\nconsidered as the most consummate school of life, and proposed for the\r\nscene of his instruction; and in this academy he had not continued many\r\nweeks, when he was an eye-witness of that famous victory, which, with\r\nsixty thousand men, the Imperial general obtained over an army of one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand Turks.\r\n\r\nHis father-in-law was engaged, and his mother would not be idle on this\r\noccasion. She was a perfect mistress of all the camp qualifications,\r\nand thought it a duty incumbent on her to contribute all that lay in\r\nher power towards distressing the enemy. With these sentiments she\r\nhovered about the skirts of the army, and the troops were no sooner\r\nemployed in the pursuit, than she began to traverse the field of battle\r\nwith a poignard and a bag, in order to consult her own interest, annoy\r\nthe foe, and exercise her humanity at the same time. In short, she had,\r\nwith amazing prowess, delivered some fifty or threescore disabled\r\nMussulmen of the pain under which they groaned, and made a comfortable\r\nbooty of the spoils of the slain, when her eyes were attracted by the\r\nrich attire of an Imperial officer, who lay bleeding on the plain, to\r\nall appearance in the agonies of death.\r\n\r\nShe could not in her heart refuse that favour to a friend and Christian\r\nshe had so compassionately bestowed upon so many enemies and infidels,\r\nand therefore drew near with the sovereign remedy, which she had\r\nalready administered with such success. As she approached this\r\ndeplorable object of pity, her ears were surprised with an ejaculation\r\nin the English tongue, which he fervently pronounced, though with a\r\nweak and languid voice, recommending his soul to God, and his family to\r\nthe protection of Heaven. Our Amazon’s purpose was staggered by this\r\nprovidential incident; the sound of her native language, so\r\nunexpectedly heard, and so pathetically delivered, had a surprising\r\neffect upon her imagination; and the faculty of reflection did not\r\nforsake her in such emergency. Though she could not recollect the\r\nfeatures of this unhappy officer, she concluded, from his appearance,\r\nthat he was some person of distinction in the service, and foresaw\r\ngreater advantage to herself in attempting to preserve his life, than\r\nshe could possibly reap from the execution of her first resolve. “If,”\r\nsaid she to herself, “I can find means of conveying him to his tent\r\nalive, he cannot but in conscience acknowledge my humanity with some\r\nconsiderable recompense; and, should he chance to survive his wounds, I\r\nhave everything to expect from his gratitude and power.”\r\n\r\nFraught with these prudential suggestions, she drew near the\r\nunfortunate stranger, and, in a softened accent of pity and condolence,\r\nquestioned him concerning his name, condition, and the nature of his\r\nmischance, at the same time making a gentle tender of her service.\r\nAgreeably surprised to hear himself accosted in such a manner, by a\r\nperson whose equipage seemed to promise far other designs, he thanked\r\nher in the most grateful terms for her humanity, with the appellation\r\nof kind countrywoman; gave her to understand that he was colonel of a\r\nregiment of horse; that he had fallen in consequence of a shot he\r\nreceived in his breast at the beginning of the action; and, finally,\r\nentreated her to procure some carriage on which he might be removed to\r\nhis tent. Perceiving him faint and exhausted with loss of blood, she\r\nraised up his head, and treated him with that cordial which was her\r\nconstant companion. At that instant, espying a small body of hussars\r\nreturning to the camp with the plunder they had taken, she invoked\r\ntheir assistance, and they forthwith carried the officer to his own\r\nquarters, where his wound was dressed, and his preserver carefully\r\ntended him until his recovery was completed.\r\n\r\nIn return for these good offices, this gentleman, who was originally of\r\nScotland, rewarded her for the present with great liberality, assured\r\nher of his influence in promoting her husband, and took upon himself\r\nthe charge of young Ferdinand’s education; the boy was immediately\r\ntaken into his protection, and entered as a trooper in his own\r\nregiment; but his good intentions towards his father-in-law were\r\nfrustrated by the death of the German, who, in a few days after this\r\ndisposition, was shot in the trenches before Temiswaer.\r\n\r\nThis event, over and above the conjugal affliction with which it\r\ninvaded the lady’s quiet, would have involved her in infinite\r\ndifficulty and distress, with regard to her temporal concerns, by\r\nleaving her unprotected in the midst of strangers, had not she been\r\nthus providentially supplied with an effectual patron in the colonel,\r\nwho was known by the appellation of Count Melvil. He no sooner saw her,\r\nby the death of her husband, detached from all personal connexions with\r\na militar"

		    "text": "Cranford, by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOUR SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the\r\nholders of houses above a certain rent are women.  If a married couple\r\ncome to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is\r\neither fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford\r\nevening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his\r\nship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great\r\nneighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a\r\nrailroad.  In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are\r\nnot at Cranford.  What could they do if they were there?  The surgeon\r\nhas his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man\r\ncannot be a surgeon.  For keeping the trim gardens full of choice\r\nflowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys\r\nwho look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing\r\nout at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the\r\ngates are left open; for deciding all questions of literature and\r\npolitics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or\r\narguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody’s\r\naffairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in admirable\r\norder; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender\r\ngood offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of\r\nCranford are quite sufficient.  “A man,” as one of them observed to me\r\nonce, “is _so_ in the way in the house!”  Although the ladies of\r\nCranford know all each other’s proceedings, they are exceedingly\r\nindifferent to each other’s opinions. Indeed, as each has her own\r\nindividuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly developed,\r\nnothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will\r\nreigns among them to a considerable degree.\r\n\r\nThe Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out\r\nin a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to\r\nprevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat.  Their\r\ndress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, “What does it\r\nsignify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?”  And\r\nif they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, “What does it\r\nsignify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?”  The materials of\r\ntheir clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are\r\nnearly as scrupulous as Miss Tyler, of cleanly memory; but I will\r\nanswer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in\r\nwear in England, was seen in Cranford—and seen without a smile.\r\n\r\n            [Picture: A magnificent family red silk umbrella]\r\n\r\nI can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a\r\ngentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to\r\npatter to church on rainy days.  Have you any red silk umbrellas in\r\nLondon?  We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in\r\nCranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it “a stick in\r\npetticoats.”  It might have been the very red silk one I have described,\r\nheld by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little\r\nlady—the survivor of all—could scarcely carry it.\r\n\r\nThen there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they\r\nwere announced to any young people who might be staying in the town,\r\nwith all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a\r\nyear on the Tinwald Mount.\r\n\r\n“Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey\r\nto-night, my dear” (fifteen miles in a gentleman’s carriage); “they will\r\ngive you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they\r\nwill call; so be at liberty after twelve—from twelve to three are our\r\ncalling hours.”\r\n\r\nThen, after they had called—\r\n\r\n“It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never\r\nto let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and\r\nreturning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter\r\nof an hour.”\r\n\r\n“But am I to look at my watch?  How am I to find out when a quarter of\r\nan hour has passed?”\r\n\r\n“You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself\r\nto forget it in conversation.”\r\n\r\nAs everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid\r\na call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about.  We kept\r\nourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had\r\nsome difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the\r\nSpartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face.  We none of us\r\nspoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and\r\nthough some might be poor, we were all aristocratic.  The Cranfordians\r\nhad that kindly _esprit de corps_ which made them overlook all\r\ndeficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their\r\npoverty.  When Mrs Forrester, for instance, gave a party in her\r\nbaby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on\r\nthe sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from\r\nunderneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural\r\nthing in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies\r\nas if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants’ hall,\r\nsecond table, with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little\r\ncharity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been\r\nstrong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted\r\nin private by her mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know\r\nwhat cakes were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that\r\nwe knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all\r\nthe morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.\r\n\r\nThere were one or two consequences arising from this general but\r\nunacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which\r\nwere not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of\r\nsociety to their great improvement.  For instance, the inhabitants of\r\nCranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under\r\nthe guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o’clock at night; and the\r\nwhole town was abed and asleep by half-past ten.  Moreover, it was\r\nconsidered “vulgar” (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything\r\nexpensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening\r\nentertainments.  Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all\r\nthat the Honourable Mrs Jamieson gave; and she was sister-in-law to the\r\nlate Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such “elegant economy.”\r\n\r\n“Elegant economy!”  How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of\r\nCranford!  There, economy was always “elegant,” and money-spending\r\nalways “vulgar and ostentatious”; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us\r\nvery peaceful and satisfied.  I never shall forget the dismay felt when\r\na certain Captain Brown came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about\r\nhis being poor—not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and\r\nwindows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud\r\nmilitary voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a\r\nparticular house.  The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning\r\nover the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman.  He was\r\na half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring\r\nrailroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little\r\ntown; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection\r\nwith the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being\r\npoor—why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry.  Death was as true\r\nand as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in\r\nthe streets.  It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite.  We had\r\ntacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of\r\nvisiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything\r\nthat they wished.  If we walked to or from a party, it was because the\r\nnight was _so_ fine, or the air _so_ refreshing, not because\r\nsedan-chairs were expensive.  If we wore prints, instead of summer\r\nsilks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till\r\nwe blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people\r\nof very moderate means.  Of course, then, we did not know what to make\r\nof a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace.  Yet,\r\nsomehow, Captain Brown made himself respected in Cranford, and was\r\ncalled upon, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary.  I was\r\nsurprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I\r\npaid to Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town.  My own\r\nfriends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit\r\nthe Captain and his daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was\r\neven admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve.  True, it was to\r\ndiscover the cause of a smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted;\r\nbut still Captain Brown walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a\r\nvoice too large for the room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man\r\nabout the house.  He had been blind to all the small slights, and\r\nomissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been received.  He\r\nhad been friendly, though the Cranford ladies had been cool; he had\r\nanswered small sarcastic compliments in good faith; and with his manly\r\nfrankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who\r\nwas not ashamed to be poor. And, at last, his excellent masculine common\r\nsense, and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic\r\ndilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the\r\nCranford ladies.  He himself went on in his course, as unaware of his\r\npopularity as he had been of the reverse; and I am sure he was startled\r\none day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some\r\ncounsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober, serious\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nIt was on this subject: An old lady had an Alderney cow, which she\r\nlooked upon as a daughter.  You could not pay the short quarter of an\r\nhour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful\r\nintelligence of this animal.  The whole town knew and kindly regarded\r\nMiss Betsy Barker’s Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and\r\nregret when, in an unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a\r\nlime-pit.  She moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but\r\nmeanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking\r\nnaked, cold, and miserable, in a bare skin.  Everybody pitied the\r\nanimal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll\r\nappearance.  Miss Betsy Barker absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay;\r\nand it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil.  This remedy,\r\nperhaps, was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she\r\nasked; but the proposal, if ever it was made, was knocked on the head by\r\nCaptain Brown’s decided “Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel\r\ndrawers, ma’am, if you wish to keep her alive.  But my advice is, kill\r\nthe poor creature at once.”\r\n\r\nMiss Betsy Barker dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she\r\nset to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney\r\nmeekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel.  I have watched\r\nher myself many a time.  Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in\r\nLondon?\r\n\r\n                  [Picture: Meekly going to her pasture]\r\n\r\nCaptain Brown had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town,\r\nwhere he lived with his two daughters.  He must have been upwards of\r\nsixty at the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left\r\nit as a residence.  But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a\r\nstiff military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made\r\nhim appear much younger than he was.  His eldest daughter looked almost\r\nas old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his\r\napparent age.  Miss Brown must have been forty; she had a sickly,\r\npained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of\r\nyouth had long faded out of sight.  Even when young she must have been\r\nplain and hard-featured.  Miss Jessie Brown was ten years younger than\r\nher sister, and twenty shades prettier.  Her face was round and dimpled.\r\n Miss Jenkyns once said, in a passion against Captain Brown (the cause\r\nof which I will tell you presently), “that she thought it was time for\r\nMiss Jessie to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to\r\nlook like a child.”  It was true there was something childlike in her\r\nface; and there will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live\r\nto a hundred. Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight\r\nat you; her nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy;\r\nshe wore her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this\r\nappearance.  I do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked\r\nher face, and so did everybody, and I do not think she could help her\r\ndimples.  She had something of her father’s jauntiness of gait and\r\nmanner; and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the\r\nattire of the two sisters—that of Miss Jessie being about two pounds per\r\nannum more expensive than Miss Brown’s.  Two pounds was a large sum in\r\nCaptain Brown’s annual disbursements.\r\n\r\nSuch was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first\r\nsaw them all together in Cranford Church.  The Captain I had met\r\nbefore—on the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some\r\nsimple alteration in the flue.  In church, he held his double eye-glass\r\nto his eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect\r\nand sang out loud and joyfully.  He made the responses louder than the\r\nclerk—an old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt\r\naggrieved at the Captain’s sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher\r\nin consequence.\r\n\r\nOn coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant\r\nattention to his two daughters.  He nodded and smiled to his\r\nacquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss\r\nBrown to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and\r\nhad waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken\r\nup her gown to walk through the wet roads.\r\n\r\nI wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Captain Brown at their\r\nparties.  We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no\r\ngentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the\r\ncard-parties.  We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the\r\nevenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we\r\nhad almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be “vulgar”; so\r\nthat when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Jenkyns, was going to have\r\na party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Browns were invited,\r\nI wondered much what would be the course of the evening.  Card-tables,\r\nwith green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was\r\nthe third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four.\r\nCandles, and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table.  The\r\nfire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last\r\ndirections; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a\r\ncandle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon as the\r\nfirst knock came.  Parties in Cranford were solemn festivities, making\r\nthe ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best\r\ndresses.  As soon as three had arrived, we sat down to “Preference,” I\r\nbeing the unlucky fourth.  The next four comers were put down\r\nimmediately to another table; and presently the tea-trays, which I had\r\nseen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were placed\r\neach on the middle of a card-table. The china was delicate egg-shell;\r\nthe old-fashioned silver glittered with polishing; but the eatables were\r\nof the slightest description.  While the trays were yet on the tables,\r\nCaptain and the Miss Browns came in; and I could see that, somehow or\r\nother, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies present.  Ruffled\r\nbrows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at his approach.  Miss Brown\r\nlooked ill, and depressed almost to gloom. Miss Jessie smiled as usual,\r\nand seemed nearly as popular as her father. He immediately and quietly\r\nassumed the man’s place in the room; attended to every one’s wants,\r\nlessened the pretty maid-servant’s labour by waiting on empty cups and\r\nbread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all in so easy and dignified\r\na manner, and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to\r\nattend to the weak, that he was a true man throughout.  He played for\r\nthreepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds;\r\nand yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye on his\r\nsuffering daughter—for suffering I was sure she was, though to many eyes\r\nshe might only appear to be irritable.  Miss Jessie could not play\r\ncards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her coming, had\r\nbeen rather inclined to be cross.  She sang, too, to an old cracked\r\npiano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth.  Miss Jessie sang,\r\n“Jock of Hazeldean” a little out of tune; but we were none of us\r\nmusical, though Miss Jenkyns beat time, out of time, by way of appearing\r\nto be so.\r\n\r\nIt was very good of Miss Jenkyns to do this; for I had seen that, a\r\nlittle before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Jessie Brown’s\r\nunguarded admission (_à propos_ of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle,\r\nher mother’s brother, who was a shopkeeper in Edinburgh.  Miss Jenkyns\r\ntried to drown this confession by a terrible cough—for the Honourable\r\nMrs Jamieson was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Jessie, and what\r\nwould she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a\r\nshop-keeper’s niece!  But Miss Jessie Brown (who had no tact, as we all\r\nagreed the next morning) _would_ repeat the information, and assure Miss\r\nPole she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required,\r\n“through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any\r\none in Edinbro’.”  It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths,\r\nand the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Jenkyns proposed music;\r\nso I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.\r\n\r\nWhen the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a\r\nquarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking\r\nover tricks; but by-and-by Captain Brown sported a bit of literature.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen any numbers of ‘The Pickwick Papers’?” said he.  (They\r\nwere then publishing in parts.)  “Capital thing!”\r\n\r\nNow Miss Jenkyns was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on\r\nthe strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good\r\nlibrary of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any\r\nconversation about books as a challenge to her.  So she answered and\r\nsaid, “Yes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of them?” exclaimed Captain Brown.  “Aren’t they\r\nfamously good?”\r\n\r\nSo urged Miss Jenkyns could not but speak.\r\n\r\n“I must say, I don’t think they are by any means equal to Dr Johnson.\r\nStill, perhaps, the author is young.  Let him persevere, and who knows\r\nwhat he may become if he will take the great Doctor for his model?”\r\nThis was evidently too much for Captain Brown to take placidly; and I\r\nsaw the words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Jenkyns had finished\r\nher sentence.\r\n\r\n“It is quite a different sort of thing, my dear madam,” he began.\r\n\r\n“I am quite aware of that,” returned she.  “And I make allowances,\r\nCaptain Brown.”\r\n\r\n“Just allow me to read you a scene out of this month’s number,” pleaded\r\nhe.  “I had it only this morning, and I don’t think the company can have\r\nread it yet.”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” said she, settling herself with an air of resignation.\r\nHe read the account of the “swarry” which Sam Weller gave at Bath.  Some\r\nof us laughed heartily.  _I_ did not dare, because I was staying in the\r\nhouse.  Miss Jenkyns sat in patient gravity.  When it was ended, she\r\nturned to me, and said with mild dignity—\r\n\r\n“Fetch me ‘Rasselas,’ my dear, out of the book-room.”\r\n\r\nWhen I had brought it to her, she turned to Captain Brown—\r\n\r\n“Now allow _me_ to read you a scene, and then the present company can\r\njudge between your favourite, Mr Boz, and Dr Johnson.”\r\n\r\nShe read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac, in a\r\nhigh-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she said, “I\r\nimagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr Johnson as a writer of\r\nfiction.”  The Captain screwed his lips up, and drummed on the table,\r\nbut he did not speak.  She thought she would give him a finishing blow\r\nor two.\r\n\r\n         [Picture: Endeavouring to beguile her into conversation]\r\n\r\n“I consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of literature, to publish\r\nin numbers.”\r\n\r\n“How was the _Rambler_ published, ma’am?” asked Captain Brown in a low\r\nvoice, which I think Miss Jenkyns could not have heard.\r\n\r\n“Dr Johnson’s style is a model for young beginners.  My father\r\nrecommended it to me when I began to write letters—I have formed my own\r\nstyle upon it; I recommended it to your favourite.”\r\n\r\n“I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such\r\npompous writing,” said Captain Brown.\r\n\r\nMiss Jenkyns felt this as a personal affront, in a way of which the\r\nCaptain had not dreamed.  Epistolary writing she and her friends\r\nconsidered as her _forte_.  Many a copy of many a letter have I seen\r\nwritten and corrected on the slate, before she “seized the half-hour\r\njust previous to post-time to assure” her friends of this or of that;\r\nand Dr Johnson was, as she said, her model in these compositions.  She\r\ndrew herself up with dignity, and only replied to Captain Brown’s last\r\nremark by saying, with marked emphasis on every syllable, “I prefer Dr\r\nJohnson to Mr Boz.”\r\n\r\nIt is said—I won’t vouch for the fact—that Captain Brown was heard to\r\nsay, _sotto voce_, “D-n Dr Johnson!”  If he did, he was penitent\r\nafterwards, as he showed by going to stand near Miss Jenkyns’ arm-chair,\r\nand endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing\r\nsubject.  But she was inexorable.  The next day she made the remark I\r\nhave mentioned about Miss Jessie’s dimples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nTHE CAPTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was impossible to live a month at Cranford and not know the daily\r\nhabits of each resident; and long before my visit was ended I knew much\r\nconcerning the whole Brown trio.  There was nothing new to be discovered\r\nrespecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly about\r\nthat from the very first.  They made no mystery of the necessity for\r\ntheir being economical.  All that remained to be discovered was the\r\nCaptain’s infinite kindness of heart, and the various modes in which,\r\nunconsciously to himself, he manifested it.  Some little anecdotes were\r\ntalked about for some time after they occurred.  As we did not read\r\nmuch, and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there\r\nwas a dearth of subjects for conversation.  We therefore discussed the\r\ncircumstance of the Captain taking a poor old woman’s dinner out of her\r\nhands one very slippery Sunday.  He had met her returning from the\r\nbakehouse as he came from church, and noticed her precarious footing;\r\nand, with the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved\r\nher of her burden, and steered along the street by her side, carrying\r\nher baked mutton and potatoes safely home.  This was thought very\r\neccentric; and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of\r\ncalls, on the Monday morning, to explain and apologise to the Cranford\r\nsense of propriety: but he did no such thing: and then it was decided\r\nthat he was ashamed, and was keeping out of sight.  In a kindly pity for\r\nhim, we began to say, “After all, the Sunday morning’s occurrence showed\r\ngreat goodness of heart,” and it was resolved that he should be\r\ncomforted on his next appearance amongst us; but, lo! he came down upon\r\nus, untouched by any sense of shame, speaking loud and bass as ever, his\r\nhead thrown back, his wig as jaunty and well-curled as usual, and we\r\nwere obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about Sunday.\r\n\r\nMiss Pole and Miss Jessie Brown had set up a kind of intimacy on the\r\nstrength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting stitches; so it\r\nhappened that when I went to visit Miss Pole I saw more of the Browns\r\nthan I had done while staying with Miss Jenkyns, who had never got over\r\nwhat she called Captain Brown’s disparaging remarks upon Dr Johnson as a\r\nwriter of light and agreeable fiction.  I found that Miss Brown was\r\nseriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain\r\noccasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I had\r\ntaken for unmitigated crossness.  Cross, too, she was at times, when the\r\nnervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance.\r\nMiss Jessie bore with her at these times, even more patiently than she\r\ndid with the bitter self-upbraidings by which they were invariably\r\nsucceeded. Miss Brown used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and\r\nirritable temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister\r\nwere obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries which\r\nwere necessaries in her condition.  She would so fain have made\r\nsacrifices for them, and have lightened their cares, that the original\r\ngenerosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper.  All this\r\nwas borne by Miss Jessie and her father with more than placidity—with\r\nabsolute tenderness. I forgave Miss Jessie her singing out of tune, and\r\nher juvenility of dress, when I saw her at home.  I came to perceive\r\nthat Captain Brown’s dark Brutus wig and padded coat (alas! too often\r\nthreadbare) were remnants of the military smartness of his youth, which\r\nhe now wore unconsciously.  He was a man of infinite resources, gained\r\nin his barrack experience.  As he confessed, no one could black his\r\nboots to please him except himself; but, indeed, he was not above saving\r\nthe little maid-servant’s labours in every way—knowing, most likely,\r\nthat his daughter’s illness made the place a hard one.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured to make peace with Miss Jenkyns soon after the memorable\r\ndispute I have named, by a present of a wooden fire-shovel (his own\r\nmaking), having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one\r\nannoyed her.  She received the present with cool gratitude, and thanked\r\nhim formally.  When he was gone, she bade me put it away in the\r\nlumber-room; feeling, probably, that no present from a man who preferred\r\nMr Boz to Dr Johnson could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when I left Cranford and went to Drumble.\r\nI had, however, several correspondents, who kept me _au fait_ as to the\r\nproceedings of the dear little town.  There was Miss Pole, who was\r\nbecoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting,\r\nand the burden of whose letter was something like, “But don’t you forget\r\nthe white worsted at Flint’s” of the old song; for at the end of every\r\nsentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission\r\nwhich I was to execute for her.  Miss Matilda Jenkyns (who did not mind\r\nbeing called Miss Matty, when Miss Jenkyns was not by) wrote nice, kind,\r\nrambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of her own; but\r\nsuddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me not to name what she\r\nhad said, as Deborah thought differently, and _she_ knew, or else\r\nputting in a postscript to the effect that, since writing the above, she\r\nhad been talking over the subject with Deborah, and was quite convinced\r\nthat, etc.—(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she\r\nhad given in the letter).  Then came Miss Jenkyns—Deborah, as she liked\r\nMiss Matty to call her, her father having once said that the Hebrew name\r\nought to be so pronounced.  I secretly think she took the Hebrew\r\nprophetess for a model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the\r\nstern prophetess in some ways, making allowance, of course, for modern\r\ncustoms and difference in dress.  Miss Jenkyns wore a cravat, and a\r\nlittle bonnet like a jockey-cap, and altogether had the appearance of a\r\nstrong-minded woman; although she would have despised the modern idea of\r\nwomen being equal to men.  Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior.\r\nBut to return to her letters.  Everything in them was stately and grand\r\nlike herself. I have been looking them over (dear Miss Jenkyns, how I\r\nhonoured her!) and I will give an extract, more especially because it\r\nrelates to our friend Captain Brown:—\r\n\r\n“The Honourable Mrs Jamieson has only just quitted me; and, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, she communicated to me the intelligence that she\r\nhad yesterday received a call from her revered husband’s quondam friend,\r\nLord Mauleverer.  You will not easily conjecture what brought his\r\nlordship within the precincts of our little town.  It was to see Captain\r\nBrown, with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the ‘plumed\r\nwars,’ and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his\r\nlordship’s head when some great peril was impending over it, off the\r\nmisnomered Cape of Good Hope.  You know our friend the Honourable Mrs\r\nJamieson’s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity, and you will\r\ntherefore not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable\r\nto disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question.  I was\r\nanxious, I confess, to ascertain in what manner Captain Brown, with his\r\nlimited establishment, could receive so distinguished a guest; and I\r\ndiscovered that his lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to\r\nrefreshing slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals\r\nduring the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence.\r\nMrs Johnson, our civil butcher’s wife, informs me that Miss Jessie\r\npurchased a leg of lamb; but, besides this, I can hear of no preparation\r\nwhatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor.\r\nPerhaps they entertained him with ‘the feast of reason and the flow of\r\nsoul’; and to us, who are acquainted with Captain Brown’s sad want of\r\nrelish for ‘the pure wells of English undefiled,’ it may be matter for\r\ncongratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by\r\nholding converse with an elegant and refined member of the British\r\naristocracy. But from some mundane failings who is altogether free?”\r\n\r\nMiss Pole and Miss Matty wrote to me by the same post.  Such a piece of\r\nnews as Lord Mauleverer’s visit was not to be lost on the Cranford\r\nletter-writers: they made the most of it.  Miss Matty humbly apologised\r\nfor writing at the same time as her sister, who was so much more capable\r\nthan she to describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a\r\nlittle bad spelling, Miss Matty’s account gave me the best idea of the\r\ncommotion occasioned by his lordship’s visit, after it had occurred;\r\nfor, except the people at the Angel, the Browns, Mrs Jamieson, and a\r\nlittle lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against\r\nthe aristocratic legs, I could not hear of any one with whom his\r\nlordship had held conversation.\r\n\r\nMy next visit to Cranford was in the summer.  There had been neither\r\nbirths, deaths, nor marriages since I was there last.  Everybody lived\r\nin the same house, and wore pretty nearly the same well-preserved,\r\nold-fashioned clothes.  The greatest event was, that Miss Jenkyns had\r\npurchased a new carpet for the drawing-room.  Oh, the busy work Miss\r\nMatty and I had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon\r\nright down on this carpet through the blindless window!  We spread\r\nnewspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work; and,\r\nlo! in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was blazing away on a\r\nfresh spot; and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of\r\nthe newspapers.  We were very busy, too, one whole morning, before Miss\r\nJenkyns gave her party, in following her directions, and in cutting out\r\nand stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to\r\nevery chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty\r\nor defile the purity of the carpet.  Do you make paper paths for every\r\nguest to walk upon in London?\r\n\r\nCaptain Brown and Miss Jenkyns were not very cordial to each other.  The\r\nliterary dispute, of which I had seen the beginning, was a “raw,” the\r\nslightest touch on which made them wince.  It was the only difference of\r\nopinion they had ever had; but that difference was enough.  Miss Jenkyns\r\ncould not refrain from talking at Captain Brown; and, though he did not\r\nreply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt and resented\r\nas very disparaging to Dr Johnson.  He was rather ostentatious in his\r\npreference of the writings of Mr Boz; would walk through the streets so\r\nabsorbed in them that he all but ran against Miss Jenkyns; and though\r\nhis apologies were earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact,\r\ndo more than startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he\r\nhad knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of\r\nliterature.  The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and more worn,\r\nand his clothes were very threadbare.  But he seemed as bright and\r\ncheerful as ever, unless he was asked about his daughter’s health.\r\n\r\n“She suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we do what we can\r\nto alleviate her pain;—God’s will be done!”  He took off his hat at\r\nthese last words.  I found, from Miss Matty, that everything had been\r\ndone, in fact.  A medical man, of high repute in that country\r\nneighbourhood, had been sent for, and every injunction he had given was\r\nattended to, regardless of expense.  Miss Matty was sure they denied\r\nthemselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable; but\r\nthey never spoke about it; and as for Miss Jessie!—“I really think she’s\r\nan angel,” said poor Miss Matty, quite overcome.  “To see her way of\r\nbearing with Miss Brown’s crossness, and the bright face she puts on\r\nafter she’s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it,\r\nis quite beautiful.  Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the\r\nCaptain at breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the Queen’s bed\r\nall night. My dear! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or\r\nher pink bows again if you saw her as I have done.”  I could only feel\r\nvery penitent, and greet Miss Jessie with double respect when I met her\r\nnext.  She looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if\r\nshe was very weak, when she spoke of her sister.  But she brightened,\r\nand sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she\r\nsaid—\r\n\r\n“But, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for kindness!  I don’t suppose\r\nany one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all\r\ncomes in a little covered basin for my sister.  The poor people will\r\nleave their earliest vegetables at our door for her.  They speak short\r\nand gruff, as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to\r\nmy heart to see their thoughtfulness.”  The tears now came back and\r\noverflowed; but after a minute or two she began to scold herself, and\r\nended by going away the same cheerful Miss Jessie as ever.\r\n\r\n“But why does not this Lord Mauleverer do something for the man who\r\nsaved his life?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, unless Captain Brown has some reason for it, he never\r\nspeaks about being poor; and he walked along by his lordship looking as\r\nhappy and cheerful as a prince; and as they never called attention to\r\ntheir dinner by apologies, and as Miss Brown was better that day, and\r\nall seemed bright, I daresay his lordship never knew how much care there\r\nwas in the background.  He did send game in the winter pretty often, but\r\nnow he is gone abroad.”\r\n\r\nI had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and\r\nsmall opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves that were gathered ere\r\nthey fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden; the\r\nlittle bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some\r\ntown-dweller, or to burn in the chamber of some invalid.  Things that\r\nmany would despise, and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to\r\nperform, were all attended to in Cranford.  Miss Jenkyns stuck an apple\r\nfull of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss Brown’s room;\r\nand as she put in each clove she uttered a Johnsonian sentence.  Indeed,\r\nshe never could think of the Browns without talking Johnson; and, as\r\nthey were seldom absent from her thoughts just then, I heard many a\r\nrolling, three-piled sentence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Brown called one day to thank Miss Jenkyns for many little\r\nkindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had rendered.  He\r\nhad suddenly become like an old man; his deep bass voice had a quavering\r\nin it, his eyes looked dim, and the lines on his face were deep.  He did\r\nnot—could not—speak cheerfully of his daughter’s state, but he talked\r\nwith manly, pious resignation, and not much.  Twice over he said, “What\r\nJessie has been to us, God only knows!” and after the second time, he\r\ngot up hastily, shook hands all round without speaking, and left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all listening\r\nwith faces aghast to some tale or other.  Miss Jenkyns wondered what\r\ncould be the matter for some time before she took the undignified step\r\nof sending Jenny out to inquire.\r\n\r\nJenny came back with a white face of terror.  “Oh, ma’am!  Oh, Miss\r\nJenkyns, ma’am!  Captain Brown is killed by them nasty cruel railroads!”\r\nand she burst into tears.  She, along with many others, had experienced\r\nthe poor Captain’s kindness.\r\n\r\n“How?—where—where?  Good God!  Jenny, don’t waste time in crying, but\r\ntell us something.”  Miss Matty rushed out into the street at once, and\r\ncollared the man who was telling the tale.\r\n\r\n [Picture: She brought the affrighted carter ... into the\r\ndrawing-room]\r\n\r\n“Come in—come to my sister at once, Miss Jenkyns, the rector’s daughter.\r\nOh, man, man! say it is not true,” she cried, as she brought the\r\naffrighted carter, sleeking down his hair, into the drawing-room, where\r\nhe stood with his wet boots on the new carpet, and no one regarded it.\r\n\r\n“Please, mum, it is true.  I seed it myself,” and he shuddered at the\r\nrecollection.  “The Captain was a-reading some new book as he was deep\r\nin, a-waiting for the down train; and there was a little lass as wanted\r\nto come to its mammy, and gave its sister the slip, and came toddling\r\nacross the line.  And he looked up sudden, at the sound of the train\r\ncoming, and seed the child, and he darted on the line and cotched it up,\r\nand his foot slipped, and the train came over him in no time.  O Lord,\r\nLord!  Mum, it’s quite true, and they’ve come over to tell his\r\ndaughters. The child’s safe, though, with only a bang on its shoulder as\r\nhe threw it to its mammy.  Poor Captain would be glad of that, mum,\r\nwouldn’t he?  God bless him!”  The great rough carter puckered up his\r\nmanly face, and turned away to hide his tears.  I turned to Miss\r\nJenkyns.  She looked very ill, as if she were going to faint, and signed\r\nto me to open the window.\r\n\r\n“Matilda, bring me my bonnet.  I must go to those girls.  God pardon me,\r\nif ever I have spoken contemptuously to the Captain!”\r\n\r\nMiss Jenkyns arrayed herself to go out, telling Miss Matilda to give the\r\nman a glass of wine.  While she was away, Miss Matty and I huddled over\r\nthe fire, talking in a low and awestruck voice.  I know we cried quietly\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nMiss Jenkyns came home in a silent mood, and we durst not ask her many\r\nquestions.  She told us that Miss Jessie had fainted, and that she and\r\nMiss Pole had had some difficulty in bringing her round; but that, as\r\nsoon as she recovered, she begged one of them to go and sit with her\r\nsister.\r\n\r\n“Mr Hoggins says she cannot live many days, and she shall be spared this\r\nshock,” said Miss Jessie, shivering with feelings to which she dared not\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\n“But how can you manage, my dear?” asked Miss Jenkyns; “you cannot bear\r\nup, she must see your tears.”\r\n\r\n“God will help me—I will not give way—she was asleep when the news came;\r\nshe may be asleep yet.  She would be so utterly miserable, not merely at\r\nmy father’s death, but to think of what would become of me; she is so\r\ngood to me.”  She looked up earnestly in their faces with her soft true\r\neyes, and Miss Pole told Miss Jenkyns afterwards she could hardly bear\r\nit, knowing, as she did, how Miss Brown treated her sister.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was settled according to Miss Jessie’s wish.  Miss Brown was\r\nto be told her father had been summoned to take a short journey on\r\nrailway business.  They had managed it in some way—Miss Jenkyns could\r\nnot exactly say how.  Miss Pole was to stop with Miss Jessie.  Mrs\r\nJamieson had sent to inquire.  And this was all we heard that night; and\r\na sorrowful night it was.  The next day a full account of the fatal\r\naccident was in the county paper which Miss Jenkyns took in.  Her eyes\r\nwere very weak, she said, and she asked me to read it.  When I came to\r\nthe “gallant gentleman was deeply engaged in the perusal of a number of\r\n‘Pickwick,’ which he had just received,” Miss Jenkyns shook her head\r\nlong and solemnly, and then sighed out, “Poor, dear, infatuated man!”\r\n\r\nThe corpse was to be taken from the station to the parish church, there\r\nto be interred.  Miss Jessie had set her heart on following it to the\r\ngrave; and no dissuasives could alter her resolve.  Her restraint upon\r\nherself made her almost obstinate; she resisted all Miss Pole’s\r\nentreaties and Miss Jenkyns’ advice.  At last Miss Jenkyns gave up the\r\npoint; and after a silence, which I feared portended some deep\r\ndispleasure against Miss Jessie, Miss Jenkyns said she should accompany\r\nthe latter to the funeral.\r\n\r\n“It is not fit for you to go alone.  It would be against both propriety\r\nand humanity were I to allow it.”\r\n\r\nMiss Jessie seemed as if she did not half like this arrangement; but her\r\nobstinacy, if she had any, had been exhausted in her determination to go\r\nto the interment.  She longed, poor thing, I have no doubt, to cry alone\r\nover the grave of the dear father to whom she had been all in all, and\r\nto give way, for one little half-hour, uninterrupted by sympathy and\r\nunobserved by friendship.  But it was not to be.  That afternoon Miss\r\nJenkyns sent out for a yard of black crape, and employed herself busily\r\nin trimming the little black silk bonnet I have spoken about.  When it\r\nwas finished she put it on, and looked at us for approbation—admiration\r\nshe despised.  I was full of sorrow, but, by one of those whimsical\r\nthoughts which come unbidden into our heads, in times of deepest grief,\r\nI no sooner saw the bonnet than I was reminded of a helmet; and in that\r\nhybrid bonnet, half helmet, half jockey-cap, did Miss Jenkyns attend\r\nCaptain Brown’s funeral, and, I believe, supported Miss Jessie with a\r\ntender, indulgent firmness which was invaluable, allowing her to weep\r\nher passionate fill before they left.\r\n\r\nMiss Pole, Miss Matty, and I, meanwhile attended to Miss Brown: and hard\r\nwork we found it to relieve her querulous and never-ending complaints.\r\nBut if we were so weary and dispirited, what must Miss Jessie have been!\r\nYet she came back almost calm as if she had gained a new strength.  She\r\nput off her mourning dress, and came in, looking pale and gentle,\r\nthanking us each with a soft long pressure of the hand.  She could even\r\nsmile—a faint, sweet, wintry smile—as if to reassure us of her power to\r\nendure; but her look made our eyes fill suddenly with tears, more than\r\nif she had cried outright.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that Miss Pole was to remain with her all the watching\r\nlivelong night; and that Miss Matty and I were to return in the morning\r\nto relieve them, and give Miss Jessie the opportunity for a few hours of\r\nsleep.  But when the morning came, Miss Jenkyns appeared at the\r\nbreakfast-table, equipped in her helmet-bonnet, and ordered Miss Matty\r\nto stay at home, as she meant to go and help to nurse.  She was\r\nevidently in a state of great friendly excitement, which she showed by\r\neating her breakfast standing, and scolding the household all round.\r\n\r\nNo nursing—no energetic strong-minded woman could help Miss Brown now.\r\nThere was that in the room as we entered which was stronger than us all,\r\nand made us shrink into solemn awestruck helplessness.  Miss Brown was\r\ndying.  We hardly knew her voice, it was so devoid of the complaining\r\ntone we had always associated with it.  Miss Jessie told me afterwards\r\nthat it, and her face too, were just what they had been formerly, when\r\nher mother’s death left her the young anxious head of the family, of\r\nwhom only Miss Jessie survived.\r\n\r\nShe was conscious of her sister’s presence, though not, I think, of\r\nours. We stood a little behind the curtain: Miss Jessie knelt with her\r\nface near her sister’s, in order to catch the last soft awful whispers.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jessie!  Jessie!  How selfish I have been!  God forgive me for\r\nletting you sacrifice yourself for me as you did!  I have so loved\r\nyou—and yet I have thought only of myself.  God forgive me!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, love! hush!” said Miss Jessie, sobbing.\r\n\r\n“And my father, my dear, dear father!  I will not complain now, if God\r\nwill give me strength to be patient.  But, oh, Jessie! tell my father\r\nhow I longed and yearned to see him at last, and to ask his forgiveness.\r\n He can never know now how I loved him—oh! if I might but tell him,\r\nbefore I die!  What a life of sorrow his has been, and I have done so\r\nlittle to cheer him!”\r\n\r\nA light came into Miss Jessie’s face.  “Would it comfort you, dearest,\r\nto think that he does know?—would it comfort you, love, to know that his\r\ncares, his sorrows”—Her voice quivered, but she steadied it into\r\ncalmness—“Mary! he has gone before you to the place where the weary are\r\nat rest.  He knows now how you loved him.”\r\n\r\nA strange look, which was not distress, came over Miss Brown’s face.\r\nShe did not speak for some time, but then we saw her lips form the\r\nwords, rather than heard the sound—“Father, mother, Harry, Archy;”—then,\r\nas if it were a new idea throwing a filmy shadow over her darkened\r\nmind—“But you will be alone, Jessie!”\r\n\r\nMiss Jessie had been feeling this all during the silence, I think; for\r\nthe tears rolled down her cheeks l"

Besides, I have consulted\r\nMr Davy Higgins, an eminent attorney of this place, who, after due\r\ninspection and consideration, declareth, That he doth not think the said\r\nLetters contain any matter which will be held actionable in the eye of\r\nthe law. Finally, if you and I should come to a right understanding, I\r\ndo declare in verbo sacerdotis, that, in case of any such prosecution,\r\nI will take the whole upon my own shoulders, even quoad fine and\r\nimprisonment, though, I must confess, I should not care to undergo\r\nflagellation: Tam ad turpitudinem, quam ad amaritudinem poenoe\r\nspectans--Secondly, concerning the personal resentment of Mr Justice\r\nLismahago, I may say, non flocci facio--I would not willingly vilipend\r\nany Christian, if, peradventure, he deserveth that epithet: albeit, I\r\nam much surprised that more care is not taken to exclude from the\r\ncommission all such vagrant foreigners as may be justly suspected of\r\ndisaffection to our happy constitution, in church and state--God forbid\r\nthat I should be so uncharitable, as to affirm, positively, that the\r\nsaid Lismahago is no better than a Jesuit in disguise; but this I will\r\nassert and maintain, totis viribus, that, from the day he qualified, he\r\nhas never been once seen intra templi parietes, that is to say, within\r\nthe parish church.\r\n\r\nThirdly, with respect to what passed at Mr Kendal’s table, when the said\r\nLismahago was so brutal in his reprehensions, I must inform you, my good\r\nSir, that I was obliged to retire, not by fear arising from his minatory\r\nreproaches, which, as I said above, I value not of a rush; but from the\r\nsudden effect produced, by a barbel’s row, which I had eaten at\r\ndinner, not knowing, that the said row is at certain seasons violently\r\ncathartic, as Galen observeth in his chapter Peri ichtos.\r\n\r\nFourthly, and lastly, with reference to the manner in which I got\r\npossession of these Letters, it is a circumstance that concerns my own\r\nconscience only; sufficeth it to say, I have fully satisfied the parties\r\nin whose custody they were; and, by this time, I hope I have also\r\nsatisfied you in such ways, that the last hand may be put to our\r\nagreement, and the work proceed with all convenient expedition; in which\r\nI hope I rest,\r\n\r\nRespected Sir, Your very humble servant,\r\n\r\nJONATHAN DUSTWICH.\r\n\r\nP.S. I propose, Deo volente, to have the pleasure of seeing you in the\r\ngreat city, towards All-hallowtide, when I shall be glad to treat with\r\nyou concerning a parcel of MS. sermons, of a certain clergyman deceased;\r\na cake of the right leaven, for the present taste of the public. Verbum\r\nsapienti, &c.\r\n\r\nJ.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Revd. Mr JONATHAN DUSTWICH, at--\r\n\r\nSIR,\r\n\r\nI received yours in course of post, and shall be glad to treat with you\r\nfor the M.S. which I have delivered to your friend Mr Behn; but can\r\nby no means comply with the terms proposed. Those things are so\r\nuncertain--Writing is all a lottery--I have been a loser by the works\r\nof the greatest men of the age--I could mention particulars, and name\r\nnames; but don’t choose it--The taste of the town is so changeable.\r\nThen there have been so many letters upon travels lately published--What\r\nbetween Smollett’s, Sharp’s, Derrick’s, Thicknesse’s, Baltimore’s, and\r\nBaretti’s, together with Shandy’s Sentimental Travels, the public seems\r\nto be cloyed with that kind of entertainment--Nevertheless, I will,\r\nif you please, run the risque of printing and publishing, and you shall\r\nhave half the profits of the impression--You need not take the trouble\r\nto bring up your sermons on my account--No body reads sermons but\r\nMethodists and Dissenters--Besides, for my own part, I am quite a\r\nstranger to that sort of reading; and the two persons, whose judgment I\r\ndepended upon in those matters, are out of the way; one is gone abroad,\r\ncarpenter of a man of war; and the other, has been silly enough to\r\nabscond, in order to avoid a prosecution for blasphemy--I’m a great\r\nloser by his going off--He has left a manual of devotion half finished\r\non my hands, after having received money for the whole copy--He was the\r\nsoundest divine, and had the most orthodox pen of all my people; and I\r\nnever knew his judgment fail, but in flying from his bread and butter on\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nBy owning you was not put in bodily fear by Lismahago, you preclude\r\nyourself from the benefit of a good plea, over and above the advantage\r\nof binding him over. In the late war, I inserted in my evening paper,\r\na paragraph that came by the post, reflecting upon the behaviour of a\r\ncertain regiment in battle. An officer of said regiment came to my shop,\r\nand, in the presence of my wife and journeyman, threatened to cut off\r\nmy ears--As I exhibited marks of bodily fear more ways than one, to the\r\nconviction of the byestanders, I bound him over; my action lay, and I\r\nrecovered. As for flagellation, you have nothing to fear, and nothing to\r\nhope, on that head--There has been but one printer flogged at the cart’s\r\ntail these thirty years; that was Charles Watson; and he assured me it\r\nwas no more than a flea-bite. C-- S-- has been threatened several times\r\nby the House of L--; but it came to nothing. If an information should\r\nbe moved for, and granted against you, as the editor of those Letters,\r\nI hope you will have honesty and wit enough to appear and take your\r\ntrial--If you should be sentenced to the pillory, your fortune is\r\nmade--As times go, that’s a sure step to honour and preferment. I shall\r\nthink myself happy if I can lend you a lift; and am, very sincerely,\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\nHENRY DAVIS. LONDON, Aug. 10th.\r\n\r\nPlease my kind service to your neighbour, my cousin Madoc--I have\r\nsent an Almanack and Court-kalendar, directed for him at Mr Sutton’s,\r\nbookseller, in Gloucester, carriage paid, which he will please to accept\r\nas a small token of my regard. My wife, who is very fond of toasted\r\ncheese, presents her compliments to him, and begs to know if there’s any\r\nof that kind, which he was so good as to send us last Christmas, to be\r\nsold in London.\r\n\r\nH. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXPEDITION OF HUMPHRY CLINKER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDOCTOR,\r\n\r\nThe pills are good for nothing--I might as well swallow snowballs to\r\ncool my reins--I have told you over and over how hard I am to move; and\r\nat this time of day, I ought to know something of my own constitution.\r\nWhy will you be so positive? Prithee send me another prescription--I am\r\nas lame and as much tortured in all my limbs as if I was broke upon the\r\nwheel: indeed, I am equally distressed in mind and body--As if I had not\r\nplagues enough of my own, those children of my sister are left me for a\r\nperpetual source of vexation--what business have people to get children\r\nto plague their neighbours? A ridiculous incident that happened\r\nyesterday to my niece Liddy, has disordered me in such a manner, that\r\nI expect to be laid up with another fit of the gout--perhaps, I may\r\nexplain myself in my next. I shall set out tomorrow morning for the\r\nHot Well at Bristol, where I am afraid I shall stay longer than I could\r\nwish. On the receipt of this send Williams thither with my saddle-horse\r\nand the demi pique. Tell Barns to thresh out the two old ricks, and send\r\nthe corn to market, and sell it off to the poor at a shilling a bushel\r\nunder market price.--I have received a snivelling letter from Griffin,\r\noffering to make a public submission and pay costs. I want none of his\r\nsubmissions, neither will I pocket any of his money. The fellow is a bad\r\nneighbour, and I desire, to have nothing to do with him: but as he is\r\npurse-proud, he shall pay for his insolence: let him give five pounds to\r\nthe poor of the parish, and I will withdraw my action; and in the mean\r\ntime you may tell Prig to stop proceedings.--Let Morgan’s widow have the\r\nAlderney cow, and forty shillings to clothe her children: but don’t say\r\na syllable of the matter to any living soul--I’ll make her pay when she\r\nis able. I desire you will lock up all my drawers, and keep the keys\r\ntill meeting; and be sure you take the iron chest with my papers into\r\nyour own custody--Forgive all, this trouble from,\r\n\r\nDear Lewis, Your affectionate M. BRAMBLE GLOUCESTER, April 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs GWYLLIM, house-keeper at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nMRS GWILLIM,\r\n\r\nWhen this cums to hand, be sure to pack up in the trunk male that stands\r\nin my closet; to be sent me in the Bristol waggon without loss of time,\r\nthe following articles, viz. my rose collard neglejay with green robins,\r\nmy yellow damask, and my black velvets with the short hoop; my bloo\r\nquilted petticot, my green mantel, my laced apron, my French commode,\r\nMacklin head and lappets and the litel box with my jowls. Williams may\r\nbring over my bum-daffee, and the viol with the easings of Dr Hill’s\r\ndockwater and Chowder’s lacksitif. The poor creature has been terribly\r\nstuprated ever since we left huom. Pray take particular care of the\r\nhouse while the family is absent. Let there be a fire constantly kept in\r\nmy brother’s chamber and mine. The maids, having nothing to do, may be\r\nsat a spinning. I desire you’ll clap a pad-luck on the wind-seller, and\r\nlet none of the men have excess to the strong bear--don’t forget to have\r\nthe gate shit every evening be dark--The gardnir and the hind may lie\r\nbelow in the landry, to partake the house, with the blunderbuss and the\r\ngreat dog; and hope you’ll have a watchful eye over the maids. I know\r\nthat hussy Mary Jones, loves to be rumping with the men. Let me know\r\nAlderney’s calf be sould yet, and what he fought--if the ould goose be\r\nsitting; and if the cobler has cut Dicky, and how pore anemil bore the\r\noperation. No more at present, but rests,\r\n\r\nYours, TABITHA BRAMBLE GLOSTAR, April 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Mrs MARY JONES, at Brambleton-hall.\r\n\r\nDEAR MOLLY,\r\n\r\nHeaving this importunity, I send, my love to you and Saul, being in good\r\nhealth, and hoping to hear the same from you; and that you and Saul will\r\ntake my poor kitten to bed with you this cold weather. We have been all\r\nin, a sad taking here at Glostar--Miss Liddy had like to have run away\r\nwith a player-man, and young master and he would adone themselves a\r\nmischief; but the squire applied to the mare, and they were, bound\r\nover.--Mistress bid me not speak a word of the matter to any Christian\r\nsoul--no more I shall; for, we servints should see all and say nothing--\r\nBut what was worse than all this, Chowder has had the misfortune to be\r\nworried by a butcher’s dog, and came home in a terrible pickle--Mistress\r\nwas taken with the asterisks, but they soon went off. The doctor was\r\nsent for to Chowder, and he subscribed a repository which did him great\r\nservice--thank God he’s now in a fair way to do well--pray take care\r\nof my box and the pillyber and put them under your own bed; for, I do\r\nsuppose madam, Gwyllim will be a prying into my secrets, now my back is\r\nturned. John Thomas is in good health, but sulky. The squire gave away\r\nan ould coat to a poor man; and John says as, how ‘tis robbing him of\r\nhis perquisites.--I told him, by his agreement he was to receive\r\nno vails; but he says as how there’s a difference betwixt vails and\r\nperquisites; and so there is for sartain. We are all going to the Hot\r\nWell, where I shall drink your health in a glass of water, being,\r\n\r\nDear Molly, Your humble servant to command, W. JENKINS GLOSTAR, April\r\n2nd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, Bart. of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nAs I have nothing more at heart than to convince you I am incapable of\r\nforgetting, or neglecting the friendship I made at college, now begin\r\nthat correspondence by letters, which you and I agreed, at parting, to\r\ncultivate. I begin it sooner than I intended, that you may have it in\r\nyour power to refute any idle reports which may be circulated to my\r\nprejudice at Oxford, touching a foolish quarrel, in which I have been\r\ninvolved on account of my sister, who had been some time settled here\r\nin a boarding-school. When I came hither with my uncle and aunt (who\r\nare our guardians) to fetch her away, I found her a fine tall girl, of\r\nseventeen, with an agreeable person; but remarkably simple, and quite\r\nignorant of the world. This disposition, and want of experience, had\r\nexposed her to the addresses of a person--I know not what to call\r\nhim, who had seen her at a play; and, with a confidence and dexterity\r\npeculiar to himself, found means to be recommended to her acquaintance.\r\nIt was by the greatest accident I intercepted one of his letters; as\r\nit was my duty to stifle this correspondence in its birth, I made it my\r\nbusiness to find him out, and tell him very freely my sentiments of\r\nthe matter. The spark did not like the stile I used, and behaved with\r\nabundance of mettle. Though his rank in life (which, by the bye, I am\r\nashamed to declare) did not entitle him to much deference; yet as his\r\nbehaviour was remarkably spirited, I admitted him to the privilege of\r\na gentleman, and something might have happened, had not we been\r\nprevented.--In short, the business took air, I know not how, and made\r\nabundance of noise--recourse was had to justice--I was obliged to give\r\nmy word and honour, &c. and to-morrow morning we set out for Bristol\r\nWells, where I expect to hear from you by the return of the post.--I\r\nhave got into a family of originals, whom I may one day attempt to\r\ndescribe for your amusement. My aunt, Mrs Tabitha Bramble, is a maiden\r\nof forty-five, exceedingly starched, vain, and ridiculous.--My uncle is\r\nan odd kind of humorist, always on the fret, and so unpleasant in his\r\nmanner, that rather than be obliged to keep him company, I’d resign all\r\nclaim to the inheritance of his estate. Indeed his being tortured by the\r\ngout may have soured his temper, and, perhaps, I may like him better on\r\nfurther acquaintance; certain it is, all his servants and neighbours in\r\nthe country are fond of him, even to a degree of enthusiasm, the reason\r\nof which I cannot as yet comprehend. Remember me to Griffy Price, Gwyn,\r\nMansel, Basset, and all the rest of my old Cambrian companions.--Salute\r\nthe bedmaker in my name--give my service to the cook, and pray take care\r\nof poor Ponto, for the sake of his old master, who is, and ever will be,\r\n\r\nDear Phillips, Your affectionate friend, and humble servant, JER.\r\nMELFORD GLOUCESTER, April 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs JERMYN at her house in Gloucester.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,\r\n\r\nHaving no mother of my own, I hope you will give me leave to disburden\r\nmy poor heart to you, who have always acted the part of a kind parent to\r\nme, ever since I was put under your care. Indeed, and indeed, my worthy\r\ngoverness may believe me, when I assure her, that I never harboured\r\na thought that was otherwise than virtuous; and, if God will give me\r\ngrace, I shall never behave so as to cast a reflection on the care you\r\nhave taken in my education. I confess I have given just cause of offence\r\nby my want of prudence and experience. I ought not to have listened to\r\nwhat the young man said; and it was my duty to have told you all that\r\npassed, but I was ashamed to mention it; and then he behaved so modest\r\nand respectful, and seemed to be so melancholy and timorous, that\r\nI could not find in my heart to do any thing that should make him\r\nmiserable and desperate. As for familiarities, I do declare, I never\r\nonce allowed him the favour of a: salute; and as to the few letters that\r\npassed between us, they are all in my uncle’s hands, and I hope they\r\ncontain nothing contrary to innocence and honour.--I am still persuaded\r\nthat he is not what he appears to be: but time will discover--mean while\r\nI will endeavour to forget a connexion, which is so displeasing to my\r\nfamily. I have cried without ceasing, and have not tasted any thing but\r\ntea, since I was hurried away from you; nor did I once close my eyes for\r\nthree nights running.--My aunt continues to chide me severely when we\r\nare by ourselves; but I hope to soften her in time, by humility\r\nand submission.--My uncle, who was so dreadfully passionate in the\r\nbeginning, has been moved by my tears and distress; and is now all\r\ntenderness and compassion; and my brother is reconciled to me on my\r\npromise to break off all correspondence with that unfortunate youth;\r\nbut, notwithstanding all their indulgence, I shall have no peace of mind\r\ntill I know my dear and ever honoured governess has forgiven her poor,\r\ndisconsolate, forlorn,\r\n\r\nAffectionate humble servant, till death, LYDIA MELFORD CLIFTON, April 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss LAETITIA WILLIS, at Gloucester.\r\n\r\nMY DEAREST LETTY,\r\n\r\nI am in such a fright, lest this should not come safe to hand by the\r\nconveyance of Jarvis the carrier, that I beg you will write me, on the\r\nreceipt of it, directing to me, under cover, to Mrs Winifred Jenkins,\r\nmy aunt’s maid, who is a good girl, and has been so kind to me in my\r\naffliction, that I have made her my confidant; as for Jarvis, he was\r\nvery shy of taking charge of my letter and the little parcel, because\r\nhis sister Sally had like to have lost her place on my account: indeed\r\nI cannot blame the man for his caution; but I have made it worth his\r\nwhile.--My dear companion and bed-fellow, it is a grievous addition to\r\nmy other misfortunes, that I am deprived of your agreeable company and\r\nconversation, at a time when I need so much the comfort of your good\r\nhumour and good sense; but, I hope, the friendship we contracted at\r\nboarding-school, will last for life--I doubt not but on my side it will\r\ndaily increase and improve, as I gain experience, and learn to know the\r\nvalue of a true friend. O, my dear Letty! what shall I say about poor\r\nMr Wilson? I have promised to break off all correspondence, and, if\r\npossible, to forget him: but, alas! I begin to perceive that will not be\r\nin my power. As it is by no means proper that the picture should remain\r\nin my hands, lest it should be the occasion of more mischief, I have\r\nsent it to you by this opportunity, begging you will either keep it safe\r\ntill better times, or return it to Mr Wilson himself, who, I suppose,\r\nwill make it his business to see you at the usual place. If he should be\r\nlow-spirited at my sending back his picture, you may tell him I have no\r\noccasion for a picture, while the original continues engraved on my--But\r\nno; I would not have you tell him that neither; because there must be an\r\nend of our correspondence--I wish he may forget me, for the sake of\r\nhis own peace; and yet if he should, he must be a barbarous--But it is\r\nimpossible--poor Wilson cannot be false and inconstant: I beseech\r\nhim not to write to me, nor attempt to see me for some time; for,\r\nconsidering the resentment and passionate temper of my brother Jery,\r\nsuch an attempt might be attended with consequences which would make\r\nus all miserable for life--let us trust to time and the chapter of\r\naccidents; or rather to that Providence which will not fail, sooner or\r\nlater, to reward those that walk in the paths of honour and virtue. I\r\nwould offer my love to the young ladies; but it is not fit that any of\r\nthem should know you have received this letter.--If we go to Bath,\r\nI shall send you my simple remarks upon that famous center of polite\r\namusement, and every other place we may chance to visit; and I flatter\r\nmyself that my dear Miss Willis will be punctual in answering the\r\nletters of her affectionate,\r\n\r\nLYDIA MELFORD CLIFTON, April 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Dr LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR LEWIS,\r\n\r\nI have followed your directions with some success, and might have\r\nbeen upon my legs by this time, had the weather permitted me to use my\r\nsaddle-horse. I rode out upon the Downs last Tuesday, in the forenoon,\r\nwhen the sky, as far as the visible horizon, was without a cloud; but\r\nbefore I had gone a full mile, I was overtaken instantaneously by a\r\nstorm of rain that wet me to the skin in three minutes--whence it came\r\nthe devil knows; but it has laid me up (I suppose) for one fortnight.\r\nIt makes me sick to hear people talk of the fine air upon Clifton-downs:\r\nHow can the air be either agreeable or salutary, where the demon of\r\nvapours descends in a perpetual drizzle? My confinement is the more\r\nintolerable, as I am surrounded with domestic vexations. My niece has\r\nhad a dangerous fit of illness, occasioned by that cursed incident at\r\nGloucester, which I mentioned in my last.--She is a poor good-natured\r\nsimpleton, as soft as butter, and as easily melted--not that she’s a\r\nfool--the girl’s parts are not despicable, and her education has not\r\nbeen neglected; that is to say, she can write and spell, and speak\r\nFrench, and play upon the harpsichord; then she dances finely, has a\r\ngood figure, and is very well inclined; but, she’s deficient in spirit,\r\nand so susceptible--and so tender forsooth!--truly, she has got a\r\nlanguishing eye, and reads romances.--Then there’s her brother, ‘squire\r\nJery, a pert jackanapes, full of college-petulance and self-conceit;\r\nproud as a German count, and as hot and hasty as a Welch mountaineer. As\r\nfor that fantastical animal, my sister Tabby, you are no stranger to her\r\nqualifications--I vow to God, she is sometimes so intolerable, that I\r\nalmost think she’s the devil incarnate come to torment me for my\r\nsins; and yet I am conscious of no sins that ought to entail such\r\nfamily-plagues upon me--why the devil should not I shake off these\r\ntorments at once? I an’t married to Tabby, thank Heaven! nor did I beget\r\nthe other two: let them choose another guardian: for my part I an’t in\r\na condition to take care of myself; much less to superintend the\r\nconduct of giddy-headed boys and girls. You earnestly desire to know the\r\nparticulars of our adventure at Gloucester, which are briefly these, and\r\nI hope they will go no further:--Liddy had been so long copped up in a\r\nboarding-school, which, next to a nunnery, is the worst kind of seminary\r\nthat ever was contrived for young women, that she became as inflammable\r\nas touch-wood; and going to a play in holiday-time,--‘sdeath, I’m\r\nashamed to tell you! she fell in love with one of the actors--a handsome\r\nyoung fellow that goes by the name of Wilson. The rascal soon perceived\r\nthe impression he had made, and managed matters so as to see her at\r\na house where she went to drink tea with her governess.--This was the\r\nbeginning of a correspondence, which they kept up by means of a jade\r\nof a milliner, who made and dressed caps for the girls at the\r\nboarding-school. When we arrived at Gloucester, Liddy came to stay at\r\nlodgings with her aunt, and Wilson bribed the maid to deliver a letter\r\ninto her own hands; but it seems Jery had already acquired so much\r\ncredit with the maid (by what means he best knows) that she carried\r\nthe letter to him, and so the whole plot was discovered. The rash boy,\r\nwithout saying a word of the matter to me, went immediately in search\r\nof Wilson; and, I suppose, treated him with insolence enough. The\r\ntheatrical hero was too far gone in romance to brook such usage: he\r\nreplied in blank verse, and a formal challenge ensued. They agreed to\r\nmeet early next morning and decide the dispute with sword and pistol. I\r\nheard nothing at all of the affair, till Mr Morley came to my bed-side\r\nin the morning, and told me he was afraid my nephew was going to fight,\r\nas he had been overheard talking very loud and vehement with Wilson\r\nat the young man’s lodgings the night before, and afterwards went\r\nand bought powder and ball at a shop in the neighbourhood. I got up\r\nimmediately, and upon inquiry found he was just going out. I begged\r\nMorley to knock up the mayor, that he might interpose as a magistrate,\r\nand in the mean time I hobbled after the squire, whom I saw at a\r\ndistance walking at a great pace towards the city gate--in spite of all\r\nmy efforts, I could not come up till our two combatants had taken their\r\nground, and were priming their pistols. An old house luckily screened\r\nme from their view; so that I rushed upon them at once, before I was\r\nperceived. They were both confounded, and attempted to make their escape\r\ndifferent ways; but Morley coming up with constables, at that instant,\r\ntook Wilson into custody, and Jery followed him quietly to the mayor’s\r\nhouse. All this time I was ignorant of what had passed the preceding\r\nday; and neither of the parties would discover a tittle of the matter.\r\nThe mayor observed that it was great presumption in Wilson, who was a\r\nstroller, to proceed to such extremities with a gentleman of family and\r\nfortune; and threatened to commit him on the vagrant act.--The young\r\nfellow bustled up with great spirit, declaring he was a gentleman, and\r\nwould be treated as such; but he refused to explain himself further. The\r\nmaster of the company being sent for, and examined, touching the said\r\nWilson, said the young man had engaged with him at Birmingham about six\r\nmonths ago; but never would take his salary; that he had behaved so well\r\nin his private character, as to acquire the respect and good-will of all\r\nhis acquaintance, and that the public owned his merit as an actor was\r\naltogether extraordinary.--After all, I fancy, he will turn out to be a\r\nrun-away prentice from London.--The manager offered to bail him for any\r\nsum, provided he would give his word and honour that he would keep the\r\npeace; but the young gentleman was on his high ropes, and would by no\r\nmeans lay himself under any restrictions: on the other hand, Hopeful was\r\nequally obstinate; till at length the mayor declared, that if they\r\nboth refused to be bound over, he would immediately commit Wilson as a\r\nvagrant to hard labour. I own I was much pleased with Jery’s behaviour\r\non this occasion: he said, that rather than Mr Wilson should be treated\r\nin such an ignominious manner, he would give his word and honour\r\nto prosecute the affair no further while they remained at\r\nGloucester--Wilson thanked him for his generous manner of proceeding,\r\nand was discharged. On our return to our lodgings, my nephew explained\r\nthe whole mystery; and I own I was exceedingly incensed--Liddy being\r\nquestioned on the subject, and very severely reproached by that wildcat\r\nmy sister Tabby, first swooned away, then dissolving in a flood of\r\ntears, confessed all the particulars of the correspondence, at the same\r\ntime giving up three letters, which was all she had received from her\r\nadmirer. The last, which Jery intercepted, I send you inclosed, and when\r\nyou have read it, I dare say you won’t wonder at the progress the writer\r\nhad made in the heart of a simple girl, utterly unacquainted with the\r\ncharacters of mankind. Thinking it was high time to remove her from such\r\na dangerous connexion, I carried her off the very next day to Bristol;\r\nbut the poor creature was so frightened and fluttered, by our threats\r\nand expostulations, that she fell sick the fourth day after our arrival\r\nat Clifton, and continued so ill for a whole week, that her life was\r\ndespaired of. It was not till yesterday that Dr Rigge declared her out\r\nof danger. You cannot imagine what I have suffered, partly from the\r\nindiscretion of this poor child, but much more from the fear of\r\nlosing her entirely. This air is intolerably cold, and the place quite\r\nsolitary--I never go down to the Well without returning low-spirited;\r\nfor there I meet with half a dozen poor emaciated creatures, with\r\nghostly looks, in the last stage of a consumption, who have made shift\r\nto linger through the winter like so many exotic plants languishing in a\r\nhot-house; but in all appearance, will drop into their graves before\r\nthe sun has warmth enough to mitigate the rigour of this ungenial\r\nspring.--If you think the Bath-water will be of any service to me, I\r\nwill go thither so soon as my niece can bear the motion of the coach.\r\nTell Barns I am obliged to him for his advice; but don’t choose to\r\nfollow it. If Davis voluntarily offers to give up the farm, the other\r\nshall have it; but I will not begin at this time of day to distress my\r\ntenants, because they are unfortunate, and cannot make regular payments:\r\nI wonder that Barns should think me capable of such oppression--As for\r\nHiggins, the fellow is a notorious poacher, to be sure; and an impudent\r\nrascal to set his snares in my own paddock; but, I suppose, he thought\r\nhe had some right (especially in my absence) to partake of what nature\r\nseems to have intended for common use--you may threaten him in my name,\r\nas much as you please, and if he repeats the offence, let me know it\r\nbefore you have recourse to justice.--I know you are a great sportsman,\r\nand oblige many of your friends: I need not tell you to make use of my\r\ngrounds; but it may be necessary to hint, that I am more afraid of my\r\nfowling-piece than of my game. When you can spare two or three brace of\r\npartridges, send them over by the stagecoach, and tell Gwyllim that she\r\nforgot to pack up my flannel and wide shoes in the trunk-mail--I shall\r\ntrouble you as usual, from time to time, till at last I suppose you will\r\nbe tired of corresponding with\r\n\r\nYour assured friend, M. BRAMBLE CLIFTON, April 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss LYDIA MELFORD.\r\n\r\nMiss Willis has pronounced my doom--you are going away, dear Miss\r\nMelford!--you are going to be removed, I know not whither! what shall I\r\ndo? which way shall I turn for consolation? I know not what I say--all\r\nnight long have I been tossed in a sea of doubts and fears, uncertainty\r\nand distraction, without being able to connect my thoughts, much less to\r\nform any consistent plan of conduct--I was even tempted to wish that\r\nI had never seen you; or that you had been less amiable, or less\r\ncompassionate to your poor Wilson; and yet it would be detestable\r\ningratitude in me to form such a wish, considering how much I am\r\nindebted to your goodness, and the ineffable pleasure I have derived\r\nfrom your indulgence and approbation--Good God! I never heard your name\r\nmentioned without emotion! the most distant prospect of being admitted\r\nto your company, filled my whole soul with a kind of pleasing alarm! as\r\nthe time approached, my heart beat with redoubled force, and every\r\nnerve thrilled with a transport of expectation; but, when I found myself\r\nactually in your presence;--when I heard you speak;--when I saw you\r\nsmile; when I beheld your charming eyes turned favourably upon me; my\r\nbreast was filled with such tumults of delight, as wholly deprived me of\r\nthe power of utterance, and wrapt me in a delirium of joy!--encouraged\r\nby your sweetness of temper and affability, I ventured to describe the\r\nfeelings of my heart--even then you did not check my presumption--you\r\npitied my sufferings and gave me leave to hope you put a\r\nfavourable--perhaps too favourable a construction, on my\r\nappearance--certain it is, I am no player in love--I speak the language\r\nof my own heart; and have no prompter but nature. Yet there is something\r\nin this heart, which I have not yet disclosed.--I flattered myself--But,\r\nI will not--I must not proceed. Dear Miss Liddy! for Heaven’s sake,\r\ncontrive, if possible, some means of letting me speak to you before you\r\nleave Gloucester; otherwise, I know not what will--But I begin to rave\r\nagain.--I will endeavour to bear this trial with fortitude--while I am\r\ncapable of reflecting upon your tenderness and truth, I surely have no\r\ncause to despair--a cloud hangs over me, and there is a dreadful weight\r\nupon my spirits! While you stay in this place, I shall continually hover\r\nabout your lodgings, as the parted soul is said to linger about the\r\ngrave where its mortal comfort lies.--I know, if it is in your power,\r\nyou will task your humanity--your compassion--shall I add, your\r\naffection?--in order to assuage the almost intolerable disquiet that\r\ntorments the heart of your afflicted,\r\n\r\nWILSON GLOUCESTER, March 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nHOT WELL, April 18.\r\n\r\nDEAR PHILLIPS,\r\n\r\nI give Mansel credit for his invention, in propagating the report that I\r\nhad a quarrel with a mountebank’s merry Andrew at Gloucester: but I have\r\ntoo much respect for every appendage of wit, to quarrel even with the\r\nlowest buffoonery; and therefore I hope Mansel and I shall always be\r\ngood friends. I cannot, however, approve of his drowning my poor\r\ndog Ponto, on purpose to convert Ovid’s pleonasm into a punning\r\nepitaph,--deerant quoque Littora Ponto: for, that he threw him into the\r\nIsis, when it was so high and impetuous, with no other view than to kill\r\nthe fleas, is an excuse that will not hold water--But I leave poor Ponto\r\nto his fate, and hope Providence will take care to accommodate Mansel\r\nwith a drier death.\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing that can be called company at the Well, I am here\r\nin a state of absolute rustication: This, however, gives me leisure to\r\nobserve the singularities in my uncle’s character, which seems to have\r\ninterested your curiosity. The truth is, his disposition and mine,\r\nwhich, like oil and vinegar, repelled one another at first, have now\r\nbegun to mix by dint of being beat up together. I was once apt to\r\nbelieve him a complete Cynic; and that nothing but the necessity of his\r\noccasions could compel him to get within the pale of society--I am now\r\nof another opinion. I think his peevishness arises partly from bodily\r\npain, and partly from a natural excess of mental sensibility; for, I\r\nsuppose, the mind as well as the body, is in some cases endued with a\r\nmorbid excess of sensation.\r\n\r\nI was t’other day much diverted with a conversation that passed in the\r\nPump-room, betwixt him and the famous Dr L--n, who is come to ply at the\r\nWell for patients. My uncle was complaining of the stink, occasioned\r\nby the vast quantity of mud and slime which the river leaves at low ebb\r\nunder the windows of the Pumproom. He observed, that the exhalations\r\narising from such a nuisance, could not but be prejudicial to the weak\r\nlungs of many consumptive patients, who came to drink the water. The\r\nDoctor overhearing this remark, made up to him, and assured him he was\r\nmistaken. He said, people in general were so misled by vulgar prejudices\r\nthat philosophy was hardly sufficient to undeceive them. Then humming\r\nthrice, he assumed a most ridiculous solemnity of aspect, and entered\r\ninto a learned investigation of the nature of stink. He observed,\r\nthat stink, or stench, meant no more than a strong impression on\r\nthe olfactory nerves; and might be applied to substances of the most\r\nopposite qualities; that in the Dutch language, stinken signifies the\r\nmost agreeable perfume, as well as the most fetid odour, as appears in\r\nVan Vloudel’s translation of Horace, in that beautiful ode, Quis multa\r\ngracilis, &c.--The words fiquidis perfusus odoribus, he translates van\r\ncivet & moschata gestinken: that individuals differed toto coelo in\r\ntheir opinion of smells, which, indeed, was altogether as arbitrary\r\nas the opinion of beauty; that the French were pleased with the putrid\r\neffluvia of animal food; and so were the Hottentots in Africa, and the\r\nSavages in Greenland; and that the Negroes on the coast of Senegal would\r\nnot touch fish till it was rotten; strong presumptions in favour of what\r\nis generally called stink, as those nations are in a state of nature,\r\nundebauched by luxury, unseduced by whim and caprice: that he had reason\r\nto believe the stercoraceous flavour, condemned by prejudice as a stink,\r\nwas, in fact, most agreeable to the organs of smelling; for, that every\r\nperson who pretended to nauseate the smell of another’s excretions,\r\nsnuffed up his own with particular complacency; for the truth of which\r\nhe appealed to all the ladies and gentlemen then present: he said, the\r\ninhabitants of Madrid and Edinburgh found particular satisfaction\r\nin breathing their own atmosphere, which was always impregnated with\r\nstercoraceous effluvia: that the learned Dr B--, in his treatise on the\r\nFour Digestions, explains in what manner the volatile effluvia from the\r\nintestines stimulate and promote the operations of the animal economy:\r\nhe affirmed, the last Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medicis family,\r\nwho refined upon sensuality with the spirit of a philosopher, was so\r\ndelighted with that odour, that he caused the essence of ordure to be\r\nextracted, and used it as the most delicious perfume: that he himself\r\n(the doctor) when he happened to be low-spirited, or fatigued with\r\nbusiness, found immediate relief and uncommon satisfaction from hanging\r\nover the stale contents of a close-stool, while his servant stirred it\r\nabout under his nose; nor was this effect to be wondered at, when we\r\nconsider that this substance abounds with the self-same volatile salts\r\nthat are so greedily smelled to by the most delicate invalids, after\r\nthey have been extracted and sublimed by the chemists.--By this time the\r\ncompany began to hold their noses; but the doctor, without taking\r\nthe least notice of this signal, proceeded to shew, that many fetid\r\nsubstances were not only agreeable but salutary; such as assa foetida,\r\nand other medicinal gums, resins, roots, and vegetables, over and above\r\nburnt feathers, tan-pits, candle-snuffs, &c. In short, he used many\r\nlearned arguments to persuade his audience out of their senses; and from\r\nstench made a transition to filth, which he affirmed was also a mistaken\r\nidea, in as much as objects so called, were no other than certain\r\nmodifications of matter, consisting of the same principles that enter\r\ninto the composition of all created essences, whatever they may be: that\r\nin the filthiest production of nature, a philosopher considered nothing\r\nbut the earth, water, salt and air, of which it was compounded; that,\r\nfor his own part, he had no more objections to drinking the dirtiest\r\nditch-water, than he had to a glass of water from the Hot Well, provided\r\nhe was assured there was nothing poisonous in the concrete. Then\r\naddressing himself to my uncle, ‘Sir (said he) you seem to be of a\r\ndropsical habit, and probably will soon have a confirmed ascites: if\r\nI should be present when you are tapped, I will give you a convincing\r\nproof of what I assert, by drinking without hesitation the water\r\nthat comes out of your abdomen.’--The ladies made wry faces at this\r\ndeclaration, and my uncle, changing colour, told him he did not desire\r\nany such proof of his philosophy: ‘But I should be glad to know (said\r\nhe) what makes you think I am of a dropsical habit?’ ‘Sir, I beg pardon\r\n(replied the Doctor) I perceive your ancles are swelled, and you seem to\r\nhave the facies leucophlegmatica. Perhaps, indeed, your disorder may\r\nbe oedematous, or gouty, or it may be the lues venerea: If you have any\r\nreason to flatter yourself it is this last, sir, I will undertake\r\nto cure you with three small pills, even if the disease should have\r\nattained its utmost inveteracy. Sir, it is an arcanum, which I have\r\ndiscovered, and prepared with infinite labour.--Sir, I have lately cured\r\na woman in Bristol--a common prostitute, sir, who had got all the worst\r\nsymptoms of the disorder; such as nodi, tophi, and gummata, verruca,\r\ncristoe Galli, and a serpiginous eruption, or rather a pocky itch\r\nall over her body. By the time she had taken the second pill, sir, by\r\nHeaven! she was as smooth as my hand, and the third made her sound and\r\nas fresh as a new born infant.’ ‘Sir (cried my uncle peevishly) I have\r\nno reason to flatter myself that my disorder comes within the efficacy\r\nof your nostrum. But this patient you talk of may not be so sound at\r\nbottom as you imagine.’ ‘I can’t possibly be mistaken (rejoined the\r\nphilosopher) for I have had communication with her three times--I always\r\nascertain my cures in that manner.’ At this remark, all the ladies\r\nretired to another corner of the room, and some of them began to\r\nspit.--As to my uncle, though he was ruffled at first by the doctor’s\r\nsaying he was dropsical, he could not help smiling at this ridiculous\r\nconfession and, I suppose, with a view to punish this original, told\r\nhim there was a wart upon his nose, that looked a little suspicious. ‘I\r\ndon’t pretend to be a judge of those matters (said he) but I understand\r\nthat warts are often produced by the distemper; and that one upon your\r\nnose seems to have taken possession of the very keystone of the\r\nbridge, which I hope is in no danger of falling.’ L--n seemed a little\r\nconfounded at this remark, and assured him it was nothing but a common\r\nexcrescence of the cuticula, but that the bones were all sound below;\r\nfor the truth of this assertion he appealed to the touch, desiring he\r\nwould feel the part. My uncle said it was a matter of such delicacy to\r\nmeddle with a gentleman’s nose, that he declined the office--upon which,\r\nthe Doctor turning to me, intreated me to do him that favour. I complied\r\nwith his request, and handled it so roughly, that he sneezed, and the\r\ntears ran down his cheeks, to the no small entertainment of the company,\r\nand particularly of my uncle, who burst out a-laughing for the first\r\ntime since I have been with him; and took notice, that the part seemed\r\nto be very tender. ‘Sir (cried the Doctor) it is naturally a tender\r\npart; but to remove all possibility of doubt, I will take off the wart\r\nthis very night.’\r\n\r\nSo saying, he bowed, with great solemnity all round, and retired to his\r\nown lodgings, where he applied a caustic to the wart; but it spread in\r\nsuch a manner as to produce a considerable inflammation, attended with\r\nan enormous swelling; so that when he next appeared, his whole face was\r\novershadowed by this tremendous nozzle; and the rueful eagerness with\r\nwhich he explained this unlucky accident, was ludicrous beyond all\r\ndescription.--I was much pleased with meeting the original of a\r\ncharacter, which you and I have often laughed at in description; and\r\nwhat surprises me very much, I find the features in the picture, which\r\nhas been drawn for him, rather softened than over-charged.\r\n\r\nAs I have something else to say; and this letter has run to an\r\nunconscionable length, I shall now give you a little respite, and\r\ntrouble you again by the very first post. I wish you would take it in\r\nyour head to retaliate these double strokes upon\r\n\r\nYours always, J. MELFORD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Sir WATKIN PHILLIPS, of Jesus college, Oxon.\r\n\r\nHOT WELL, April 20.\r\n\r\nDEAR KNIGHT,\r\n\r\nI now sit down to execute the threat in the tail of my last. The truth\r\nis, I am big with the secret, and long to be delivered. It relates to my\r\nguardian, who, you know, is at present our principal object in view.\r\n\r\nT’other day, I thought I had detected him in such a state of frailty, as\r\nwould but ill become his years and character. There is a decent sort of\r\nwoman, not disagreeable in her person, that comes to the Well, with a\r\npoor emaciated child, far gone in a consumption. I had caught my uncle’s\r\neyes several times directed to this person, with a very suspicious\r\nexpression in them, and every time he saw himself observed, he hastily\r\nwithdrew them, with evident marks of confusion--I resolved to watch him\r\nmore narrowly, and saw him speaking to her privately in a corner of the\r\nwalk. At length, going down to the Well one day, I met her half way up\r\nthe hill to Clifton, and could not help suspecting she was going to our\r\nlodgings by appointment, as it was about one o’clock, the hour when my\r\nsister and I are generally at the Pump-room.--This notion exciting my\r\ncuriosity, I returned by a back-way, and got unperceived into my own\r\nchamber, which is contiguous to my uncle’s apartment. Sure enough, the\r\nwoman was introduced but not into his bedchamber; he gave her audience\r\nin a parlour; so that I was obliged to shift my station to another room,\r\nwhere, however, there was a small chink in the partition, through which\r\nI could perceive what passed. My uncle, though a little lame, rose up\r\nwhen she came in, and setting a chair for her, desired she would sit\r\ndown: then he asked if she would take a dish of chocolate, which she\r\ndeclined, with much acknowledgment. After a short pause, he said, in a\r\ncroaking tone of voice, which confounded me not a little, ‘Madam, I am\r\ntruly concerned for your misfortunes; and if this trifle can be of any\r\nservice to you, I beg you will accept it without ceremony.’ So saying,\r\nhe put a bit of paper into her hand, which she opening with great\r\ntrepidation, exclaimed in an extacy, ‘Twenty pounds! Oh, sir!’ and\r\nsinking down upon a settee, fainted away--Frightened at this fit, and,\r\nI suppose, afraid of calling for assistance, lest her situation\r\nshould give rise to unfavourable conjectures, he ran about the room in\r\ndistraction, making frightful grimaces; and, at length, had recollection\r\nenough to throw a little water in her face; by which application she was\r\nbrought to herself: but, then her feeling took another turn. She shed\r\na flood of tears, and cried aloud, ‘I know not who you are: but,\r\nsure--worthy sir--generous sir!--the distress of me and my poor dying\r\nchild--Oh! if the widow’s prayers--if the orphan’s tears of gratitude\r\ncan ought avail--gracious Providence--Blessings!--shower down eternal\r\nblessings.’--Here she was interrupted by my uncle, who muttered in\r\na voice still more and more discordant, ‘For Heaven’s sake be quiet,\r\nmadam--consider--the people of the house--‘sdeath! can’t you.’--All this\r\ntime she was struggling to throw herself on her knees, while he seizing\r\nher by the wrists, endeavoured to seat her upon the settee, saying,\r\n‘Prithee--good now--hold your tongue’--At that instant, who should\r\nburst into--the room but our aunt Tabby! of all antiquated maidens the\r\nmost diabolically capricious--Ever prying into other people’s affairs,\r\nshe had seen the woman enter, and followed her to the door, where she\r\nstood listening, but probably could hear nothing distinctly, except my\r\nuncle’s, last exclamation; at which she bounded into the parlour in a\r\nviolent rage, that dyed the tip of her nose of a purple hue,--‘Fy upon\r\nyou, Matt! (cried she) what doings are these, to disgrace your own\r\ncharacter, and disparage your family?’--Then, snatching the bank note\r\nout of the stranger’s hand, she went on--‘How now, twenty\r\npounds!--here is temptation with a witness!--Good-woman, go about\r\nyour business--Brother, brother, I know not which most to admire; your\r\nconcupissins, or your extravagance!’--‘Good God (exclaimed the poor\r\nwoman) shall a worthy gentleman’s character suffer for an action\r\nthat does honour to humanity?’ By this time, uncle’s indignation was\r\neffectually roused. His face grew pale, his teeth chattered, and his\r\neyes flashed--‘Sister (cried he, in a voice like thunder) I vow to God,\r\nyour impertinence is exceedingly provoking.’ With these words, he took\r\nher by the hand, and, opening the door of communication, thrust her into\r\nthe chamber where I stood, so affected by the scene, that the tears ran\r\ndown my cheeks. Observing these marks of emotion, ‘I don’t wonder (said\r\nshe) to see you concerned at the back-slidings of so near a relation; a\r\nman of his years and infirmities: These are fine doings, truly--This\r\nis a rare example, set by a guardian, for the benefit of his\r\npupils--Monstrous! incongruous! sophistical!’--I thought it was but\r\nan act of justice to set her to rights; and therefore explained the\r\nmystery. But she would not be undeceived, ‘What (said she) would you\r\ngo for to offer for to arguefy me out of my senses? Did’n’t I hear\r\nhim whispering to her to hold her tongue? Did’n’t I see her in tears?\r\nDid’n’t I see him struggling to throw her upon the couch? 0 filthy!\r\nhideous! abominable! Child, child, talk not to me of charity.--Who gives\r\ntwenty pounds in charity?--But you are a stripling--You know nothing of\r\nthe world. Besides, charity begins at home--Twenty pounds would buy me a\r\ncomplete suit of flowered silk, trimmings and all--’ In short, I quitted\r\nthe room, my contempt for her, and my respect for her brother, being\r\nincreased in the same proportion. I have since been informed, that the\r\nperson, whom my uncle so generously relieved, is the widow of an ensign,\r\nwho has nothing to depend upon but the pension of fifteen pounds a year.\r\nThe people of the Well-house give her an excellent character. She lodges\r\nin a garret, and works very hard at plain work, to support her daughter,\r\nwho is dying of a consumption. I must own, to my shame, I feel a strong\r\ninclination to follow m"

		    "text": "The Adventures of Roderick Random, by Tobias Smollett\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nOf my Birth and Parentage\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born in the northern part of this united kingdom, in the house of\r\nmy grandfather, a gentleman of considerable fortune and influence, who\r\nhad on many occasions signalised himself in behalf of his country; and\r\nwas remarkable for his abilities in the law, which he exercised with\r\ngreat success in the station of a judge, particularly against beggars,\r\nfor whom he had a singular aversion.\r\n\r\nMy father (his youngest son) falling in love with a poor relation, who\r\nlived with the old gentleman in quality of a housekeeper, espoused her\r\nprivately; and I was the first fruit of that marriage. During her\r\npregnancy, a dream discomposed my mother so much that her husband,\r\ntired with her importunity, at last consulted a highland seer, whose\r\nfavourable interpretation he would have secured beforehand by a bribe,\r\nbut found him incorruptible. She dreamed she was delivered of a\r\ntennis-ball, which the devil (who, to her great surprise, acted the\r\npart of a midwife) struck so forcibly with a racket that it disappeared\r\nin an instant; and she was for some time inconsolable for the lost of\r\nher offspring; when, all on a sudden, she beheld it return with equal\r\nviolence, and enter the earth, beneath her feet, whence immediately\r\nsprang up a goodly tree covered with blossoms, the scent of which\r\noperated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke. The attentive sage,\r\nafter some deliberation, assured my parents, that their firstborn would\r\nbe a great traveller; that he would undergo many dangers and\r\ndifficulties, and at last return to his native land, where he would\r\nflourish in happiness and reputation. How truly this was foretold will\r\nappear in the sequel. It was not long before some officious person\r\ninformed my grandfather of certain familiarities that passed between\r\nhis son and housekeeper which alarmed him so much that, a few days\r\nafter, he told my father it was high time for him to think of settling;\r\nand that he had provided a match for him, to which he could in justice\r\nhave no objections. My father, finding it would be impossible to\r\nconceal his situation much longer, frankly owned what he had done; and\r\nexcused himself for not having asked the consent of his father, by\r\nsaying, he knew it would have been to no purpose; and that, had his\r\ninclination been known, my grandfather might have taken such measures\r\nas would have effectually put the gratification of it out of his power:\r\nhe added, that no exceptions could be taken to his wife’s virtue,\r\nbirth, beauty, and good sense, and as for fortune, it was beneath his\r\ncare. The old gentleman, who kept all his passions, except one, in\r\nexcellent order, heard him to an end with great temper, and then calmly\r\nasked, how he proposed to maintain himself and spouse? He replied, he\r\ncould be in no danger of wanting while his father’s tenderness\r\nremained, which he and his wife should always cultivate with the utmost\r\nveneration; and he was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the\r\ndignity and circumstances of his family, and to the provision already\r\nmade for his brothers and sisters, who were happily settled under his\r\nprotection. “Your brothers and sisters,” said my grandfather, “did not\r\nthink it beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as\r\nmatrimony; neither, I suppose, would you have omitted that piece of\r\nduty, had you not some secret fund in reserve; to the comforts of which\r\nI leave you, with a desire that you will this night seek out another\r\nhabitation for yourself and wife, whither, in a short time, I will send\r\nyou an account of the expense I have been at in your education, with a\r\nview of being reimbursed. Sir, you have made the grand tour—you are a\r\npolite gentleman—a very pretty gentleman—I wish you a great deal of\r\njoy, and am your very humble servant.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he left my father in a situation easily imagined. However,\r\nhe did not long hesitate; for, being perfectly well acquainted with his\r\nfather’s disposition, he did not doubt that he was glad of this\r\npretence to get rid of him; and his resolves being as invariable as the\r\nlaws of the Medes and Persians, he knew it would be to no purpose to\r\nattempt him by prayers and entreaties; so without any farther\r\napplication, he betook himself, with his disconsolate bedfellow to a\r\nfarm-house, where an old servant of his mother dwelt: there they\r\nremained some time in a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of\r\ntheir desires and tenderness of their love; which nevertheless my\r\nfather chose to endure, rather than supplicate an unnatural and\r\ninflexible parent but my mother, foreseeing the inconveniences to which\r\nshe must have been exposed, had she been delivered in this place (and\r\nher pregnancy was very far advanced), without communicating her design\r\nto her husband, went in disguise to the house of my grandfather, hoping\r\nthat her tears and condition would move him to compassion, and\r\nreconcile him to an event which was now irrecoverably past.\r\n\r\nShe found means to deceive the servants, and get introduced as an\r\nunfortunate lady, who wanted to complain of some matrimonial\r\ngrievances, it being my grandfather’s particular province to decide in\r\nall cases of scandal. She was accordingly admitted into his presence,\r\nwhere, discovering herself, she fell at his feet, and in the most\r\naffecting manner implored his forgiveness; at the same time\r\nrepresenting the danger that threatened not only her life, but that of\r\nhis own grandchild, which was about to see the light. He told her he\r\nwas sorry that the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to\r\nmake a vow, which put it out of his power to give them any assistance;\r\nthat he had already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her\r\nhusband, and was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any\r\nfarther importunity. This said, he retired.\r\n\r\nThe violence of my mother’s affliction had such an effect on her\r\nconstitution that she was immediately seized with the pains of\r\nchildbed; and had not an old maidservant, to whom she was very dear,\r\nafforded her pity and assistance, at the hazard of incurring my\r\ngrandfather’s displeasure, she and the innocent fruit of her womb must\r\nhave fallen miserable victims to his rigour and inhumanity. By the\r\nfriendship of this poor woman she was carried up to a garret, and\r\nimmediately delivered of a man child, the story of whose unfortunate\r\nbirth he himself now relates. My father, being informed of what had\r\nhappened, flew to the embraces of his darling spouse, and while he\r\nloaded his offspring with paternal embraces, could not forbear shedding\r\na flood of tears on beholding the dear partner of his heart (for whose\r\nease he would have sacrificed the treasures of the east) stretched upon\r\na flock bed, in a miserable apartment, unable to protect her from the\r\ninclemencies of the weather. It is not to be supposed that the old\r\ngentleman was ignorant of what passed, though he affected to know\r\nnothing of the matter, and pretended to be very much surprised, when\r\none of his grandchildren, by his eldest son deceased, who lived with\r\nhim as his heir apparent, acquainted him with the affair; he determined\r\ntherefore to observe no medium, but immediately (on the third day after\r\nher delivery) sent her a peremptory order to be gone, and turned off\r\nthe servant who had preserved her life. This behaviour so exasperated\r\nmy father that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations; and\r\non his bare knees implored that Heaven would renounce him if ever he\r\nshould forget or forgive the barbarity of his sire.\r\n\r\nThe injuries which this unhappy mother received from her removal in\r\nsuch circumstances, and the want of necessaries where she lodged,\r\ntogether with her grief and anxiety of mind, soon threw her into a\r\nlanguishing disorder, which put an end to her life. My father, who\r\nloved her tenderly, was so affected with her death that he remained six\r\nweeks deprived of his senses; during which time, the people where he\r\nlodged carried the infant to the old man who relented so far, on\r\nhearing the melancholy story of his daughter-in-law’s death, and the\r\ndeplorable condition of his son, as to send the child to nurse, and he\r\nordered my father to be carried home to his house, where he soon\r\nrecovered the use of his reason.\r\n\r\nWhether this hardhearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment\r\nof his son and daughter, or (which is more probable) was afraid his\r\ncharacter would suffer in the neighbourhood, he professed great sorrow\r\nfor his conduct to my father, whose delirium was succeeded by a\r\nprofound melancholy and reserve. At length he disappeared, and,\r\nnotwithstanding all imaginable inquiry, could not be heard of; a\r\ncircumstance which confirmed most people in the opinion of his having\r\nmade away with himself in a fit of despair. How I understood the\r\nparticulars of my birth will appear in the course of these memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nI grow up—am hated by my Relations—sent to School—neglected by my\r\nGrandfather—maltreated by my Master—seasoned to Adversity—I form Cabals\r\nagainst the Pedant—am debarred Access to my Grandfather—hunted by his\r\nHeir—I demolish the Teeth of his Tutor\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting some who suspected my uncles of being concerned\r\nin my father’s fate, on the supposition that they would all share in\r\nthe patrimony destined for him; and this conjecture was strengthened by\r\nreflecting that in all his calamities they never discovered the least\r\ninclination to serve him; but, on the contrary, by all the artifices in\r\ntheir power, fed his resentment and supported his resolution of leaving\r\nhim to misery and want. But people of judgment treated this insinuation\r\nas an idle chimera; because, had my relations been so wicked as to\r\nconsult their interest by committing such an atrocious crime, the fate\r\nof my father would have extended to me too whose life was another\r\nobstacle to their expectation. Meanwhile, I grew apace, and as I\r\nstrongly resembled my father, who was the darling of the tenants, I\r\nwanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford: but\r\ntheir favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my\r\ncousins; who the more my infancy promised, conceived the more\r\nimplacable hatred against me: and before I was six years of age, had so\r\neffectually blockaded my grandfather that I never saw him but by\r\nstealth, when I sometimes made up to his chair as he sat to view his\r\nlabourers in the field: on which occasion he would stroke my head, bid\r\nme be a good boy, and promise to take care of me.\r\n\r\nI was soon after sent to school at a village hard by, of which he had\r\nbeen dictator time out of mind; but as he never paid for my board, nor\r\nsupplied me with clothes, books, and other necessaries I required, my\r\ncondition was very ragged and contemptible, and the schoolmaster, who,\r\nthrough fear of my grandfather, taught me gratis, gave himself no\r\nconcern about the progress I made under his instruction. In spite of\r\nall these difficulties and disgraces, I became a good proficient in the\r\nLatin tongue; and, as soon as I could write tolerably, pestered my\r\ngrandfather with letters to such a degree that he sent for my master,\r\nand chid him severely for bestowing such pains on my education, telling\r\nhim that, if ever I should be brought to the gallows for forgery, which\r\nhe had taught me to commit, my blood would lie on his head.\r\n\r\nThe pedant, who dreaded nothing more than the displeasure of his\r\npatron, assured his honour that the boy’s ability was more owing to his\r\nown genius and application than to any instruction or encouragement he\r\nreceived; that, although he could not divest him of the knowledge he\r\nhad already imbibed, unless he would empower him to disable his\r\nfingers, he should endeavour, with God’s help, to prevent his future\r\nimprovement. And, indeed, he punctually performed what he had\r\nundertaken; for, on pretence that I had written impertinent letters to\r\nmy grandfather, he caused a board to be made with five holes in it,\r\nthrough which he thrust the fingers and thumb of my right hand, and\r\nfastened it by whipcord to my wrist, in such a manner as effectually\r\ndebarred me the use of my pen. But this restraint I was freed from in a\r\nfew days, by an accident which happened in a quarrel between me and\r\nanother boy; who, taking upon him to insult my poverty, I was so\r\nincensed at his ungenerous reproach that with one stroke with my\r\nmachine I cut him to the skull, to the great terror of myself and\r\nschoolfellows, who left him bleeding on the ground, and ran to inform\r\nthe master of what had happened. I was so severely punished for this\r\ntrespass that, were I to live to the age of Methusalem, the impression\r\nit made on me would not be effaced; the more than the antipathy and\r\nhorror I conceived for the merciless tyrant who inflicted it. The\r\ncontempt which my appearance naturally produced in all who saw me, the\r\ncontinual wants to which I was exposed, and my own haughty disposition,\r\nimpatient of affronts, involved me in a thousand troublesome\r\nadventures, by which I was at length inured in adversity, and\r\nemboldened to undertakings far above my years. I was often inhumanly\r\nscourged for crimes I did not commit, because, having the character of\r\na vagabond in the village, every piece of mischief, whose author lay\r\nunknown, was charged upon me. I have been found guilty of robbing\r\norchards I never entered, of killing cats I never hunted, of stealing\r\ngingerbread I never touched, and of abusing old women I never saw. Nay,\r\na stammering carpenter had eloquence enough to persuade my master that\r\nI fired a pistol loaded with small shot into his window; though my\r\nlandlady and the whole family bore witness that I was abed fast asleep\r\nat the time when this outrage was committed. I was once flogged for\r\nhaving narrowly escaped drowning, by the sinking of a ferry boat in\r\nwhich I was passenger. Another time, for having recovered of a bruise\r\noccasioned by a horse and cart running over me. A third time, for being\r\nbitten by a baker’s dog. In short, whether I was guilty or unfortunate,\r\nthe correction and sympathy of this arbitrary pedagogue were the same.\r\n\r\nFar from being subdued by this informal usage, my indignation triumphed\r\nover that slavish awe which had hitherto enforced my obedience; and the\r\nmore my years and knowledge increased, the more I perceived the\r\ninjustice and barbarity of his behaviour. By the help of an uncommon\r\ngenius, and the advice and direction of our usher, who had served my\r\nfather in his travels, I made a surprising progress in the classics,\r\nwriting, and arithmetic; so that, before I was twelve years old, I was\r\nallowed by everybody to be the best scholar in the school. This\r\nqualification, together with the boldness of temper and strength of\r\nmake which had subjected almost all my contemporaries, gave me such\r\ninfluence over them that I began to form cabals against my persecutor;\r\nand was in hope of, being able to bid him defiance in a very short\r\ntime. Being at the head of a faction, consisting of thirty boys, most\r\nof them of my own age, I was determined to put their mettle to trial,\r\nthat I might know how far they were to be depended upon, before I put\r\nmy grand scheme in execution: with this view, we attacked a body of\r\nstout apprentices, who had taken possession of a part of the ground\r\nallotted to us for the scheme of our diversions, and who were then\r\nplaying at ninepins on the spot; but I had the mortification to see my\r\nadherents routed in an instant, and a leg of one of them broke in his\r\nflight by the bowl, which one of our adversaries had detached in\r\npursuit of us. This discomfiture did not hinder us from engaging them\r\nafterwards in frequent skirmishes, which we maintained by throwing\r\nstones at a distance, wherein I received many wounds, the scars of\r\nwhich still remain. Our enemies were so harassed and interrupted by\r\nthese alarms that they at last abandoned their conquest, and left us to\r\nthe peaceable enjoyment of our own territories.\r\n\r\nIt would be endless to enumerate the exploits we performed in the\r\ncourse of this confederacy, which became the terror of the whole\r\nvillage; insomuch that, when different interests divided it, one of the\r\nparties commonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random (by which\r\nname I was known) to cast the balance, and keep the opposite faction in\r\nawe. Meanwhile, I took the advantage of every play-day to present\r\nmyself before my grandfather, to whom I seldom found access, by reason\r\nof his being closely besieged by a numerous family of his female\r\ngrandchildren, who, though they perpetually quarrelled among\r\nthemselves, never failed to join against me, as the common enemy of\r\nall. His heir, who was about the age of eighteen, minded nothing but\r\nfox-hunting, and indeed was qualified for nothing else, notwithstanding\r\nhis grandfather’s indulgence in entertaining a tutor for him at home;\r\nwho at the same time performed the office of parish clerk. This young\r\nActaeon, who inherited his grandfather’s antipathy to everything in\r\ndistress, never sat eyes on me without uncoupling his beagles, and\r\nhunting me into some cottage or other, whither I generally fled for\r\nshelter. In this Christian amusement he was encouraged by his\r\npreceptor, who, no doubt, took such opportunities to ingratiate himself\r\nwith the rising sun, observing, that the old gentleman, according to\r\nthe course of nature, had not long to live, for he was already on the\r\nverge of fourscore.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much, that one\r\nday, when I was beleaguered by him and his hounds in a farmer’s house,\r\nwhere I had found protection, I took aim at him (being an excellent\r\nmarksman) with a large pebble, which struck out four of his foreteeth,\r\nand effectually incapacitated him from doing the office of a clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Mother’s Brother arrives—relieves me—a Description of him—he goes\r\nalong with me to the House of my Grandfather—is encountered by his\r\nDogs—defeats them, after a bloody Engagement—is admitted to the old\r\nGentleman—a Dialogue between them\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time my mother’s only brother, who had been long abroad,\r\nlieutenant of a man-of-war, arrived in his own country; where being\r\ninformed of my condition, he came to see me, and out of his slender\r\nfinances not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the\r\npresent, but resolved not to leave the country until he had prevailed\r\non my grandfather to settle something handsome for the future. This was\r\na task to which he was by no means equal, being entirely ignorant, not\r\nonly of the judge’s disposition, but also of the ways of men in\r\ngeneral, to which his education on board had kept him an utter\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nHe was a strong built man, somewhat bandy legged, with a neck like that\r\nof a bull, and a face which (you might easily perceive) had withstood\r\nthe most obstinate assaults of the weather. His dress consisted of a\r\nsoldier’s coat altered for him by the ship’s tailor, a striped flannel\r\njacket, a pair of red breeches spanned with pitch, clean gray worsted\r\nstockings, large silver buckles that covered three-fourths of his\r\nshoes, a silver-laced hat, whose crown overlooked the brims about an\r\ninch and a half, black bobwig in buckle, a check shirt, a silk\r\nhandkerchief, a hanger, with a brass handle, girded to his thigh by a\r\nfurnished lace belt, and a good oak plant under his arm. Thus equipped,\r\nhe set out with me (who by his bounty made a very decent appearance)\r\nfor my grandfather’s house, where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar,\r\nwhom my cousin, young master, had let loose at our approach. Being well\r\nacquainted with the inveteracy of these curs, I was about to betake\r\nmyself to my heels, when my uncle seized me with one hand, brandished\r\nhis cudgel with the other, and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the\r\nground; but, finding himself attacked at the same time in the rear by\r\nJowler, and fearing Caesar might recover, he drew his hanger, wheeled\r\nabout, and by a lucky stroke severed Jowler’s head from his body. By\r\nthis time, the young foxhunter and three servants, armed with\r\npitchforks and flails, were come to the assistance of the dogs, whom\r\nthey found breathless upon the field; and my cousin was so provoked at\r\nthe death of his favourites, that he ordered his attendants to advance,\r\nand take vengeance on their executioner, whom he loaded with all the\r\ncurses and reproaches his anger could suggest. Upon which my uncle\r\nstepped forwards with an undaunted air, at the sight of whose bloody\r\nweapons his antagonists fell back with precipitation, when he accosted\r\ntheir leader thus:\r\n\r\n“Lookee, brother, your dogs having boarded me without provocation, what\r\nI did was in my own defence. So you had best be civil, and let us shoot\r\na head, clear of you.”\r\n\r\nWhether the young squire misinterpreted my uncle’s desire of peace, or\r\nwas enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his usual pitch of\r\nresolution, I know not; but he snatched a flail from one of his\r\nfollowers, and came up with a show of assaulting the lieutenant, who,\r\nputting himself in a posture of defence, proceeded thus: “Lookee, you\r\nlubberly son of a w—e, if you come athwart me, ’ware your gingerbread\r\nwork. I’ll be foul of your quarter, d—n me.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration, followed by a flourish of his hanger, seemed to check\r\nthe progress of the young gentleman’s choler, who, looking behind him,\r\nperceived his attendants had slunk into the house, shut the gate, and\r\nleft him to decide the contention by himself.\r\n\r\nHere a parley ensued, which was introduced by my cousin’s asking, “Who\r\nthe devil are you? What do you want? Some scoundrel of a seaman, I\r\nsuppose, who has deserted and turned thief. But don’t think you shall\r\nescape, sirrah—I’ll have you hang’d, you dog, I will. Your blood shall\r\npay for that of my two hounds, you ragamuffin. I would not have parted\r\nwith them to save your whole generation from the gallows, you ruffian,\r\nyou!” “None of your jaw, you swab—none of your jaw,” replied my uncle,\r\n“else I shall trim your laced jacket for you. I shall rub you down with\r\nan oaken towel, my boy, I shall.” So saying, he sheathed his hanger,\r\nand grasped his cudgel. Meanwhile the people of the house being\r\nalarmed, one of my female cousins opened a window, and asked what was\r\nthe matter. “The matter!” answered the lieutenant; “no great matter,\r\nyoung woman; I have business with the old gentleman, and this spark,\r\nbelike, won’t allow me to come alongside of him,” that’s all. After a\r\nfew minutes pause we were admitted, and conducted to my grandfather’s\r\nchamber through a lane of my relations, who honoured me with very\r\nsignificant looks as I passed along. When we came into the judge’s\r\npresence my uncle, after two or three sea-bows, expressed himself in\r\nthis manner; “Your servant, your servant. What cheer, father? what\r\ncheer? I suppose you don’t know me—mayhap you don’t. My name is Tom\r\nBowling, and this here boy, you look as if you did not know him\r\nneither; ’tis like you mayn’t. He’s new rigged, i’faith; his cloth\r\ndon’t shake in the wind so much as it wont to do. ’Tis my nephew, d’y\r\nsee, Roderick Random—your own flesh and blood, old gentleman. Don’t lay\r\na-stern, you dog,” pulling me forward. My grandfather (who was laid up\r\nwith the gout) received this relation, after his long absence, with\r\nthat coldness of civility which was peculiar to him; told him he was\r\nglad to see him, and desired him to sit down. “Thank ye, thank ye, sir,\r\nI had as lief stand,” said my uncle; “for my own part, I desire nothing\r\nof you; but, if you have any conscience at all, do something for this\r\npoor boy, who has been used at a very unchristian rate. Unchristian do\r\nI call it? I am sure the Moors in Barbary have more humanity than to\r\nleave their little ones to want. I would fain know why my sister’s son\r\nis more neglected than that there fair-weather Jack” (pointing to the\r\nyoung squire, who with the rest of my cousins had followed us into the\r\nroom). “Is not he as near akin to you as the other? Is he not much\r\nhandsomer and better built than that great chucklehead? Come, come,\r\nconsider, old gentleman, you are going in a short time to give an\r\naccount of your evil actions. Remember the wrongs you did his father,\r\nand make all the satisfaction in your power before it be too late. The\r\nleast thing you can do is to settle his father’s portion on him.”\r\n\r\nThe young ladies, who thought themselves too much concerned to contain\r\nthemselves any longer, set up their throats all together against my\r\nprotector—“Scurvy companion—saucy tarpaulin—rude, impertinent fellow,\r\ndid he think to prescribe to grandpapa? His sister’s brat had been too\r\nwell taken care of. Grandpapa was too just not make a difference\r\nbetween an unnatural, rebellious son and his dutiful, loving children,\r\nwho took his advice in all things;” and such expressions were vented\r\nagainst him with great violence; until the judge at length commanded\r\nsilence. He calmly rebuked my uncle for his unmannerly behaviour, which\r\nhe said he would excuse on account of his education: he told him he had\r\nbeen very kind to the boy, whom he had kept at school seven or eight\r\nyears, although he was informed he made no progress in his learning but\r\nwas addicted to all manner of vice, which he rather believed, because\r\nhe himself was witness to a barbarous piece of mischief he had\r\ncommitted on the jaws of his chaplain. But, however, he would see what\r\nthe lad was fit for, and bind him apprentice to some honest tradesman\r\nor other, provided he would mend his manners, and behave for the future\r\nas became him.\r\n\r\nThe honest tar (whose pride and indignation boiled within him) answered\r\nmy grandfather, that it was true he had sent him to school, but it had\r\ncost him nothing, for he had never been at one shilling expense to\r\nfurnish him with food, raiment, books, or other necessaries; so that it\r\nwas not much to be wondered at, if the boy made small progress; and yet\r\nwhoever told him so was a lying, lubberly rascal, and deserved to be\r\nkeel-haul’d; for though he (the lieutenant) did not understand those\r\nmatters himself, he was well informed as how Rory was the best scholar\r\nof his age in all the country; the truth of which he would maintain, by\r\nlaying a wager of his whole half-year’s pay on the boy’s head—with\r\nthese words he pulled out his purse, and challenged the company:\r\n“Neither is he predicted to vice, as you affirm, but rather, left like\r\na wreck, d’ye see, at the mercy of the wind and weather, by your\r\nneglect, old gentleman. As for what happened to your chaplain, I am\r\nonly sorry that he did not knock out the scoundrel’s brains instead of\r\nhis teeth. By the Lord, if ever I come up with him, he had better be in\r\nGreenland, that’s all. Thank you for your courteous offer of binding\r\nthe lad apprentice to a tradesman. I suppose you would make a tailor of\r\nhim—would you? I had rather see him hang’d, d’ye see. Come along, Rory,\r\nI perceive how the land lies, my boy—let’s tack about, i’faith—while I\r\nhave a shilling you shan’t want a tester. B’we, old gentleman; you’re\r\nbound for the other world, but I believe damnably ill-provided for the\r\nvoyage.” Thus ended our visit; and we returned to the village, my uncle\r\nmuttering curses all the way against the old shark and the young fry\r\nthat surrounded him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Grandfather makes his Will—our second Visit—he Dies—his Will is read\r\nin Presence of all his living Descendants—the Disappointment of my\r\nfemale Cousins—my Uncle’s Behaviour\r\n\r\n\r\nA few weeks after our first visit, we were informed that the old judge,\r\nat the end of a fit of thoughtfulness, which lasted three days, had\r\nsent for a notary and made his will; that the distemper had mounted\r\nfrom his legs to his stomach, and, being conscious of his approaching\r\nend, he had desired to see all his descendants without exception. In\r\nobedience to this summons, my uncle set out with me a second time, to\r\nreceive the last benediction of my grandfather: often repeating by the\r\nroad, “Ey, ey, we have brought up the old hulk at last. You shall\r\nsee—you shall see the effect of my admonition,” When we entered his\r\nchamber, which was crowded with his relations, we advanced to the\r\nbedside, where we found him in his last agonies, supported by two of\r\nhis granddaughters, who sat on each side of him, sobbing most\r\npiteously, and wiping away the froth and slaver as it gathered on his\r\nlips, which they frequently kissed with a show of great anguish and\r\naffection. My uncle approached him with these words, “What! he’s not\r\na-weigh. How fare ye? how fare ye, old gentleman? Lord have mercy upon\r\nyour poor sinful soul!” Upon which, the dying man turned his languid\r\neyes towards us, and Mr. Bowling went on—“Here’s poor Roy come to see\r\nyou before you die, and to receive your blessing. What, man! don’t\r\ndespair, you have been a great sinner, ’tis true,—what then? There’s a\r\nrighteous judge above, an’t there? He minds me no more than a porpoise.\r\nYes, yes, he’s a-going; the land crabs will have him, I see that! his\r\nanchor’s a-peak, i’faith.” This homely consolation scandalised the\r\ncompany so much, and especially the parson, who probably thought his\r\nprovince invaded, that we were obliged to retire into another room,\r\nwhere, in a few minutes, we were convinced of my grandfather’s decease,\r\nby a dismal yell uttered by the young ladies in his apartment; whither\r\nwe immediately hastened, and found his heir, who had retired a little\r\nbefore into a closet, under pretence of giving vent to his sorrow,\r\nasking, with a countenance beslubbered with tears, if his grandpapa was\r\ncertainly dead? “Dead!” (says my uncle, looking, at the body) “ay, ay,\r\nI’ll warrant him as dead as a herring. Odd’s fish! now my dream is out\r\nfor all the world. I thought I stood upon the forecastle, and saw a\r\nparcel of carrion crows foul of a dead shark: that floated alongside,\r\nand the devil perching upon our spritsail yard, in the likeness of a\r\nblue bear—who, d’ye see jumped overboard upon the carcass and carried\r\nit to the bottom in his claws.” “Out upon thee, reprobate” cries the\r\nparson “out upon thee, blasphemous wretch! Dost thou think his honour’s\r\nsoul is in the possession of Satan?” The clamour immediately arose, and\r\nmy poor uncle, being, shouldered from one corner of the room to the\r\nother, was obliged to lug out in his own defence, and swear he would\r\nturn out for no man, till such time as he knew who had the title to\r\nsend him adrift. “None of your tricks upon travellers,” said he;\r\n“mayhap old Bluff has left my kinsman here his heir: if he has, it will\r\nbe the better for his miserable soul. Odds bob! I’d desire no better\r\nnews. I’d soon make him a clear shin, I warrant you.” To avoid any\r\nfurther disturbance, one of my grandfather’s executors, who was\r\npresent, assured Mr. Bowling, that his nephew should have all manner of\r\njustice; that a day should be appointed after the funeral for examining\r\nthe papers of the deceased, in presence of all his relations; till\r\nwhich time every desk and cabinet in the house should remain close\r\nsealed; and that he was very welcome to be witness to this ceremony,\r\nwhich was immediately performed to his satisfaction. In the meantime,\r\norders were given to provide mourning for all the relations, in which\r\nnumber I was included; but my uncle would not suffer me to accept of\r\nit, until I should be assured whether or no I had reason to honour his\r\nmemory so far. During this interval, the conjectures of people, with\r\nregard to the old gentleman’s will, were various: as it was well known,\r\nhe had, besides his landed estate, which was worth £700 per annum, six\r\nor seven thousand pounds at interest, some imagined that the whole real\r\nestate (which he had greatly improved) would go to the young man whom\r\nhe always entertained as his heir; and that the money would be equally\r\ndivided between my female cousins (five in number) and me. Others were\r\nof opinion, that, as the rest of the children had been already provided\r\nfor, he would only bequeath two or three hundred pounds to each of his\r\ngranddaughters, and leave the bulk of the sum to me, to atone for his\r\nunnatural usage of my father. At length the important hour arrived, and\r\nthe will was produced in the midst of the expectants, whose looks and\r\ngestures formed a group that would have been very entertaining to an\r\nunconcerned spectator. But, the reader can scarce conceive the\r\nastonishment and mortification that appeared, when an attorney\r\npronounced aloud, the young squire sole heir of all his grandfather’s\r\nestate, personal and real. My uncle, who had listened with great\r\nattention, sucking the head of his cudgel all the while, accompanied\r\nthese words of the attorney with a stare, and whew, that alarmed the\r\nwhole assembly. The eldest and pertest of my female competitors, who\r\nhad been always very officious about my grandfather’s person, inquired,\r\nwith a faltering accent and visage as yellow as an orange, “if there\r\nwere no legacies?” and was answered, “None at all.” Upon which she\r\nfainted away. The rest, whose expectations, perhaps, were not so\r\nsanguine, supported their disappointment with more resolution, though\r\nnot without giving evident marks of indignation, and grief at least as\r\ngenuine as that which appeared in them at the old gentleman’s death. My\r\nconductor, after having kicked with his heel for some time against the\r\nwainscot, began: “So there’s no legacy, friend, ha!—here’s an old\r\nsuccubus; but somebody’s soul howls for it, d—n me!” The parson of the\r\nparish, who was one of the executors, and had acted as ghostly director\r\nto the old man, no sooner heard this exclamation than he cried out,\r\n“Avaunt, unchristian reviler! avaunt! wilt thou not allow the soul of\r\nhis honour to rest in peace?” But this zealous pastor did not find\r\nhimself so warmly seconded, as formerly, by the young ladies, who now\r\njoined my uncle against him, and accused him of having acted the part\r\nof a busybody with their grandpapa whose ears he had certainly abused\r\nby false stories to their prejudice, or else he would not have\r\nneglected them in such an unnatural manner. The young squire was much\r\ndiverted with this scene, and whispered to my uncle, that if he had not\r\nmurdered his dogs, he would have shown him glorious fun, by hunting a\r\nblack badger (so he termed the clergyman). The surly lieutenant, who\r\nwas not in a humour to relish this amusement, replied, “You and your\r\ndogs may be damn’d. I suppose you’ll find them with your old dad, in\r\nthe latitude of hell. Come, Rory,—about ship, my lad, we must steer\r\nanother course, I think.” And away we went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Schoolmaster uses me barbarously—I form a Project of Revenge, in\r\nwhich I am assisted by my Uncle—I leave the Village—am settled at a\r\nUniversity by his Generosity\r\n\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the village, my uncle spoke not a word during the\r\nspace of a whole hour, but whistled with great vehemence the tune of\r\n“Why should we quarrel for riches,” etc. his visage being contracted\r\nall the while into a most formidable frown. At length his pace\r\nincreased to such a degree that I was left behind a considerable way:\r\nthen he waited for me; and when I was almost up with him, called out in\r\na surly tone, “Bear a hand, damme! must I bring to every minute for\r\nyou, you lazy dog.” Then, laying hold of me by the arm, hauled me\r\nalong, until his good nature (of which he had a great share) and\r\nreflection getting the better of his he said, “Come, my boy, don’t be\r\ncast down,—the old rascal is in hell, that’s some satisfaction; you\r\nshall go to sea with me, my lad. A light heart and a thin pair of\r\nbreeches goes through the world, brave boys, as the song goes—eh!”\r\nThough this proposal did not at all suit my inclination, I was afraid\r\nof discovering my aversion to it, lest I should disoblige the only\r\nfriend I had in the world; and he was so much a seaman that he never\r\ndreamt I could have had any objection to his design; consequently gave\r\nhimself no trouble in consulting my approbation. But this resolution\r\nwas soon dropped, by the device of our usher, who assured Mr. Bowling,\r\nit would be a thousand pities to balk my genius, which would certainly\r\none day make my fortune on shore, provided it received due cultivation.\r\nUpon which, this generous tar determined (though he could ill afford\r\nit) to give me university education; and accordingly settled my board\r\nand other expenses, at a town not many miles distant, famous for its\r\ncolleges, whither we repaired in a short time. But, before the day of\r\nour departure, the schoolmaster, who no longer had the fear of my\r\ngrandfather before his eyes, laid aside all decency and restraint, and\r\nnot only abused me in the grossest language his rancour could suggest,\r\nas a wicked, profligate, dull, beggarly miscreant, whom he had taught\r\nout of charity; but also inveigh"

		    "text": "The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, by Henry Fielding\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR\r\nPROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter i.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a\r\nprivate or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public\r\nordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the\r\nformer case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare\r\nhe pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly\r\ndisagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any\r\nfault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to\r\napprove and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary\r\nof this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what\r\nthey eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and\r\nwhimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their\r\ntaste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their\r\ndinner without controul.\r\n\r\nTo prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such\r\ndisappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning\r\nhost to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their\r\nfirst entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves\r\nwith the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and\r\nregale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other\r\nordinary better accommodated to their taste.\r\n\r\nAs we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is\r\ncapable of lending us either, we have condescended to take a hint from\r\nthese honest victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general bill of\r\nfare to our whole entertainment, but shall likewise give the reader\r\nparticular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and\r\nthe ensuing volumes.\r\n\r\nThe provision, then, which we have here made is no other than _Human\r\nNature_. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious\r\nin his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named\r\nbut one article. The tortoise--as the alderman of Bristol, well\r\nlearned in eating, knows by much experience--besides the delicious\r\ncalipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can\r\nthe learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here\r\ncollected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a\r\ncook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal\r\nand vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to\r\nexhaust so extensive a subject.\r\n\r\nAn objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that\r\nthis dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of\r\nall the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls\r\nabound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it\r\nwas a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and\r\nvulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under\r\nthe same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with\r\nin authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in\r\nthe shops.\r\n\r\nBut the whole, to continue the same metaphor, consists in the cookery\r\nof the author; for, as Mr Pope tells us--\r\n\r\n    “True wit is nature to advantage drest;\r\n    What oft was thought, but ne'er so well exprest.”\r\n\r\nThe same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh\r\neaten at the table of a duke, may perhaps be degraded in another part,\r\nand some of his limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vilest stall in\r\ntown. Where, then, lies the difference between the food of the\r\nnobleman and the porter, if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf,\r\nbut in the seasoning, the dressing, the garnishing, and the setting\r\nforth? Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite,\r\nand the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the excellence of the mental entertainment consists\r\nless in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up.\r\nHow pleased, therefore, will the reader be to find that we have, in\r\nthe following work, adhered closely to one of the highest principles\r\nof the best cook which the present age, or perhaps that of\r\nHeliogabalus, hath produced. This great man, as is well known to all\r\nlovers of polite eating, begins at first by setting plain things\r\nbefore his hungry guests, rising afterwards by degrees as their\r\nstomachs may be supposed to decrease, to the very quintessence of\r\nsauce and spices. In like manner, we shall represent human nature at\r\nfirst to the keen appetite of our reader, in that more plain and\r\nsimple manner in which it is found in the country, and shall hereafter\r\nhash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian seasoning of\r\naffectation and vice which courts and cities afford. By these means,\r\nwe doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for\r\never, as the great person just above-mentioned is supposed to have\r\nmade some persons eat.\r\n\r\nHaving premised thus much, we will now detain those who like our bill\r\nof fare no longer from their diet, and shall proceed directly to serve\r\nup the first course of our history for their entertainment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter ii.\r\n\r\nA short description of squire Allworthy, and a fuller account of Miss\r\nBridget Allworthy, his sister.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly\r\ncalled Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a\r\ngentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the\r\nfavourite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have\r\ncontended which should bless and enrich him most. In this contention,\r\nnature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed\r\non him many gifts, while fortune had only one gift in her power; but\r\nin pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps\r\nmay think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to\r\nall the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature. From the\r\nformer of these, he derived an agreeable person, a sound constitution,\r\na solid understanding, and a benevolent heart; by the latter, he was\r\ndecreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful\r\nwoman, of whom he had been extremely fond: by her he had three\r\nchildren, all of whom died in their infancy. He had likewise had the\r\nmisfortune of burying this beloved wife herself, about five years\r\nbefore the time in which this history chuses to set out. This loss,\r\nhowever great, he bore like a man of sense and constancy, though it\r\nmust be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head;\r\nfor he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married, and\r\nconsidered his wife as only gone a little before him, a journey which\r\nhe should most certainly, sooner or later, take after her; and that he\r\nhad not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he\r\nshould never part with her more--sentiments for which his sense was\r\narraigned by one part of his neighbours, his religion by a second, and\r\nhis sincerity by a third.\r\n\r\nHe now lived, for the most part, retired in the country, with one\r\nsister, for whom he had a very tender affection. This lady was now\r\nsomewhat past the age of thirty, an aera at which, in the opinion of\r\nthe malicious, the title of old maid may with no impropriety be\r\nassumed. She was of that species of women whom you commend rather for\r\ngood qualities than beauty, and who are generally called, by their own\r\nsex, very good sort of women--as good a sort of woman, madam, as you\r\nwould wish to know. Indeed, she was so far from regretting want of\r\nbeauty, that she never mentioned that perfection, if it can be called\r\none, without contempt; and would often thank God she was not as\r\nhandsome as Miss Such-a-one, whom perhaps beauty had led into errors\r\nwhich she might have otherwise avoided. Miss Bridget Allworthy (for\r\nthat was the name of this lady) very rightly conceived the charms of\r\nperson in a woman to be no better than snares for herself, as well as\r\nfor others; and yet so discreet was she in her conduct, that her\r\nprudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to\r\napprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex. Indeed, I have\r\nobserved, though it may seem unaccountable to the reader, that this\r\nguard of prudence, like the trained bands, is always readiest to go on\r\nduty where there is the least danger. It often basely and cowardly\r\ndeserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing, sighing,\r\ndying, and spreading every net in their power; and constantly attends\r\nat the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have\r\na more distant and awful respect, and whom (from despair, I suppose,\r\nof success) they never venture to attack.\r\n\r\nReader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to\r\nacquaint thee that I intend to digress, through this whole history, as\r\noften as I see occasion, of which I am myself a better judge than any\r\npitiful critic whatever; and here I must desire all those critics to\r\nmind their own business, and not to intermeddle with affairs or works\r\nwhich no ways concern them; for till they produce the authority by\r\nwhich they are constituted judges, I shall not plead to their\r\njurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter iii.\r\n\r\nAn odd accident which befel Mr Allworthy at his return home. The\r\ndecent behaviour of Mrs Deborah Wilkins, with some proper\r\nanimadversions on bastards.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have told my reader, in the preceding chapter, that Mr Allworthy\r\ninherited a large fortune; that he had a good heart, and no family.\r\nHence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many that he lived like an\r\nhonest man, owed no one a shilling, took nothing but what was his own,\r\nkept a good house, entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at\r\nhis table, and was charitable to the poor, i.e. to those who had\r\nrather beg than work, by giving them the offals from it; that he died\r\nimmensely rich and built an hospital.\r\n\r\nAnd true it is that he did many of these things; but had he done\r\nnothing more I should have left him to have recorded his own merit on\r\nsome fair freestone over the door of that hospital. Matters of a much\r\nmore extraordinary kind are to be the subject of this history, or I\r\nshould grossly mis-spend my time in writing so voluminous a work; and\r\nyou, my sagacious friend, might with equal profit and pleasure travel\r\nthrough some pages which certain droll authors have been facetiously\r\npleased to call _The History of England_.\r\n\r\nMr Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London, on\r\nsome very particular business, though I know not what it was; but\r\njudge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home,\r\nwhence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of\r\nmany years. He came to his house very late in the evening, and after a\r\nshort supper with his sister, retired much fatigued to his chamber.\r\nHere, having spent some minutes on his knees--a custom which he never\r\nbroke through on any account--he was preparing to step into bed, when,\r\nupon opening the cloathes, to his great surprize he beheld an infant,\r\nwrapt up in some coarse linen, in a sweet and profound sleep, between\r\nhis sheets. He stood some time lost in astonishment at this sight;\r\nbut, as good nature had always the ascendant in his mind, he soon\r\nbegan to be touched with sentiments of compassion for the little\r\nwretch before him. He then rang his bell, and ordered an elderly\r\nwoman-servant to rise immediately, and come to him; and in the\r\nmeantime was so eager in contemplating the beauty of innocence,\r\nappearing in those lively colours with which infancy and sleep always\r\ndisplay it, that his thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he\r\nwas in his shirt when the matron came in. She had indeed given her\r\nmaster sufficient time to dress himself; for out of respect to him,\r\nand regard to decency, she had spent many minutes in adjusting her\r\nhair at the looking-glass, notwithstanding all the hurry in which she\r\nhad been summoned by the servant, and though her master, for aught she\r\nknew, lay expiring in an apoplexy, or in some other fit.\r\n\r\nIt will not be wondered at that a creature who had so strict a regard\r\nto decency in her own person, should be shocked at the least deviation\r\nfrom it in another. She therefore no sooner opened the door, and saw\r\nher master standing by the bedside in his shirt, with a candle in his\r\nhand, than she started back in a most terrible fright, and might\r\nperhaps have swooned away, had he not now recollected his being\r\nundrest, and put an end to her terrors by desiring her to stay without\r\nthe door till he had thrown some cloathes over his back, and was\r\nbecome incapable of shocking the pure eyes of Mrs Deborah Wilkins,\r\nwho, though in the fifty-second year of her age, vowed she had never\r\nbeheld a man without his coat. Sneerers and prophane wits may perhaps\r\nlaugh at her first fright; yet my graver reader, when he considers the\r\ntime of night, the summons from her bed, and the situation in which\r\nshe found her master, will highly justify and applaud her conduct,\r\nunless the prudence which must be supposed to attend maidens at that\r\nperiod of life at which Mrs Deborah had arrived, should a little\r\nlessen his admiration.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs Deborah returned into the room, and was acquainted by her\r\nmaster with the finding the little infant, her consternation was\r\nrather greater than his had been; nor could she refrain from crying\r\nout, with great horror of accent as well as look, “My good sir! what's\r\nto be done?” Mr Allworthy answered, she must take care of the child\r\nthat evening, and in the morning he would give orders to provide it a\r\nnurse. “Yes, sir,” says she; “and I hope your worship will send out\r\nyour warrant to take up the hussy its mother, for she must be one of\r\nthe neighbourhood; and I should be glad to see her committed to\r\nBridewell, and whipt at the cart's tail. Indeed, such wicked sluts\r\ncannot be too severely punished. I'll warrant 'tis not her first, by\r\nher impudence in laying it to your worship.” “In laying it to me,\r\nDeborah!” answered Allworthy: “I can't think she hath any such design.\r\nI suppose she hath only taken this method to provide for her child;\r\nand truly I am glad she hath not done worse.” “I don't know what is\r\nworse,” cries Deborah, “than for such wicked strumpets to lay their\r\nsins at honest men's doors; and though your worship knows your own\r\ninnocence, yet the world is censorious; and it hath been many an\r\nhonest man's hap to pass for the father of children he never begot;\r\nand if your worship should provide for the child, it may make the\r\npeople the apter to believe; besides, why should your worship provide\r\nfor what the parish is obliged to maintain? For my own part, if it was\r\nan honest man's child, indeed--but for my own part, it goes against me\r\nto touch these misbegotten wretches, whom I don't look upon as my\r\nfellow-creatures. Faugh! how it stinks! It doth not smell like a\r\nChristian. If I might be so bold to give my advice, I would have it\r\nput in a basket, and sent out and laid at the churchwarden's door. It\r\nis a good night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well\r\nwrapt up, and put in a warm basket, it is two to one but it lives till\r\nit is found in the morning. But if it should not, we have discharged\r\nour duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for\r\nsuch creatures to die in a state of innocence, than to grow up and\r\nimitate their mothers; for nothing better can be expected of them.”\r\n\r\nThere were some strokes in this speech which perhaps would have\r\noffended Mr Allworthy, had he strictly attended to it; but he had now\r\ngot one of his fingers into the infant's hand, which, by its gentle\r\npressure, seeming to implore his assistance, had certainly out-pleaded\r\nthe eloquence of Mrs Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it\r\nwas. He now gave Mrs Deborah positive orders to take the child to her\r\nown bed, and to call up a maid-servant to provide it pap, and other\r\nthings, against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper cloathes\r\nshould be procured for it early in the morning, and that it should be\r\nbrought to himself as soon as he was stirring.\r\n\r\nSuch was the discernment of Mrs Wilkins, and such the respect she bore\r\nher master, under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place, that her\r\nscruples gave way to his peremptory commands; and she took the child\r\nunder her arms, without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its\r\nbirth; and declaring it was a sweet little infant, walked off with it\r\nto her own chamber.\r\n\r\nAllworthy here betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart\r\nthat hungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied.\r\nAs these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other\r\nhearty meal, I should take more pains to display them to the reader,\r\nif I knew any air to recommend him to for the procuring such an\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter iv.\r\n\r\nThe reader's neck brought into danger by a description; his escape;\r\nand the great condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gothic stile of building could produce nothing nobler than Mr\r\nAllworthy's house. There was an air of grandeur in it that struck you\r\nwith awe, and rivalled the beauties of the best Grecian architecture;\r\nand it was as commodious within as venerable without.\r\n\r\nIt stood on the south-east side of a hill, but nearer the bottom than\r\nthe top of it, so as to be sheltered from the north-east by a grove of\r\nold oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile,\r\nand yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the grove was a fine lawn, sloping down towards the\r\nhouse, near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring, gushing out\r\nof a rock covered with firs, and forming a constant cascade of about\r\nthirty feet, not carried down a regular flight of steps, but tumbling\r\nin a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the\r\nbottom of the rock, then running off in a "

		    "text": "Twenty Years After, by Alexandre Dumas, Père\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nThe Shade of Cardinal Richelieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a splendid chamber of the Palais Royal, formerly styled the Palais\r\nCardinal, a man was sitting in deep reverie, his head supported on his\r\nhands, leaning over a gilt and inlaid table which was covered with\r\nletters and papers. Behind this figure glowed a vast fireplace alive\r\nwith leaping flames; great logs of oak blazed and crackled on the\r\npolished brass andirons whose flicker shone upon the superb habiliments\r\nof the lonely tenant of the room, which was illumined grandly by twin\r\ncandelabra rich with wax-lights.\r\n\r\nAny one who happened at that moment to contemplate that red simar—the\r\ngorgeous robe of office—and the rich lace, or who gazed on that pale\r\nbrow, bent in anxious meditation, might, in the solitude of that\r\napartment, combined with the silence of the ante-chambers and the\r\nmeasured paces of the guards upon the landing-place, have fancied that\r\nthe shade of Cardinal Richelieu lingered still in his accustomed haunt.\r\n\r\nIt was, alas! the ghost of former greatness. France enfeebled, the\r\nauthority of her sovereign contemned, her nobles returning to their\r\nformer turbulence and insolence, her enemies within her frontiers—all\r\nproved the great Richelieu no longer in existence.\r\n\r\nIn truth, that the red simar which occupied the wonted place was his no\r\nlonger, was still more strikingly obvious from the isolation which\r\nseemed, as we have observed, more appropriate to a phantom than a\r\nliving creature—from the corridors deserted by courtiers, and courts\r\ncrowded with guards—from that spirit of bitter ridicule, which, arising\r\nfrom the streets below, penetrated through the very casements of the\r\nroom, which resounded with the murmurs of a whole city leagued against\r\nthe minister; as well as from the distant and incessant sounds of guns\r\nfiring—let off, happily, without other end or aim, except to show to\r\nthe guards, the Swiss troops and the military who surrounded the Palais\r\nRoyal, that the people were possessed of arms.\r\n\r\nThe shade of Richelieu was Mazarin. Now Mazarin was alone and\r\ndefenceless, as he well knew.\r\n\r\n“Foreigner!” he ejaculated, “Italian! that is their mean yet mighty\r\nbyword of reproach—the watchword with which they assassinated, hanged,\r\nand made away with Concini; and if I gave them their way they would\r\nassassinate, hang, and make away with me in the same manner, although\r\nthey have nothing to complain of except a tax or two now and then.\r\nIdiots! ignorant of their real enemies, they do not perceive that it is\r\nnot the Italian who speaks French badly, but those who can say fine\r\nthings to them in the purest Parisian accent, who are their real foes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” Mazarin continued, whilst his wonted smile, full of\r\nsubtlety, lent a strange expression to his pale lips; “yes, these\r\nnoises prove to me, indeed, that the destiny of favorites is\r\nprecarious; but ye shall know I am no ordinary favorite. No! The Earl\r\nof Essex, ’tis true, wore a splendid ring, set with diamonds, given him\r\nby his royal mistress, whilst I—I have nothing but a simple circlet of\r\ngold, with a cipher on it and a date; but that ring has been blessed in\r\nthe chapel of the Palais Royal,* so they will never ruin me, as they\r\nlong to do, and whilst they shout, ‘Down with Mazarin!’ I, unknown, and\r\nunperceived by them, incite them to cry out, ‘Long live the Duke de\r\nBeaufort’ one day; another, ‘Long live the Prince de Conde;’ and again,\r\n‘Long live the parliament!’” And at this word the smile on the\r\ncardinal’s lips assumed an expression of hatred, of which his mild\r\ncountenance seemed incapable. “The parliament! We shall soon see how to\r\ndispose,” he continued, “of the parliament! Both Orleans and Montargis\r\nare ours. It will be a work of time, but those who have begun by crying\r\nout: Down with Mazarin! will finish by shouting out, Down with all the\r\npeople I have mentioned, each in his turn.\r\n\r\n* It is said that Mazarin, who, though a cardinal, had not taken such\r\nvows as to prevent it, was secretly married to Anne of Austria.—La\r\nPorte’s Memoirs.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Richelieu, whom they hated during his lifetime and whom they now\r\npraise after his death, was even less popular than I am. Often he was\r\ndriven away, oftener still had he a dread of being sent away. The queen\r\nwill never banish me, and even were I obliged to yield to the populace\r\nshe would yield with me; if I fly, she will fly; and then we shall see\r\nhow the rebels will get on without either king or queen.\r\n\r\n“Oh, were I not a foreigner! were I but a Frenchman! were I but of\r\ngentle birth!”\r\n\r\nThe position of the cardinal was indeed critical, and recent events had\r\nadded to his difficulties. Discontent had long pervaded the lower ranks\r\nof society in France. Crushed and impoverished by taxation—imposed by\r\nMazarin, whose avarice impelled him to grind them down to the very\r\ndust—the people, as the Advocate-General Talon described it, had\r\nnothing left to them except their souls; and as those could not be sold\r\nby auction, they began to murmur. Patience had in vain been recommended\r\nto them by reports of brilliant victories gained by France; laurels,\r\nhowever, were not meat and drink, and the people had for some time been\r\nin a state of discontent.\r\n\r\nHad this been all, it might not, perhaps, have greatly signified; for\r\nwhen the lower classes alone complained, the court of France, separated\r\nas it was from the poor by the intervening classes of the gentry and\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_, seldom listened to their voice; but unluckily,\r\nMazarin had had the imprudence to attack the magistrates and had sold\r\nno less than twelve appointments in the Court of Requests, at a high\r\nprice; and as the officers of that court paid very dearly for their\r\nplaces, and as the addition of twelve new colleagues would necessarily\r\nlower the value of each place, the old functionaries formed a union\r\namongst themselves, and, enraged, swore on the Bible not to allow of\r\nthis addition to their number, but to resist all the persecutions which\r\nmight ensue; and should any one of them chance to forfeit his post by\r\nthis resistance, to combine to indemnify him for his loss.\r\n\r\nNow the following occurrences had taken place between the two\r\ncontending parties.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of January between seven and eight hundred tradesmen had\r\nassembled in Paris to discuss a new tax which was to be levied on house\r\nproperty. They deputed ten of their number to wait upon the Duke of\r\nOrleans, who, according to his custom, affected popularity. The duke\r\nreceived them and they informed him that they were resolved not to pay\r\nthis tax, even if they were obliged to defend themselves against its\r\ncollectors by force of arms. They were listened to with great\r\npoliteness by the duke, who held out hopes of easier measures, promised\r\nto speak in their behalf to the queen, and dismissed them with the\r\nordinary expression of royalty, “We will see what we can do.”\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward these same magistrates appeared before the cardinal\r\nand their spokesman addressed Mazarin with so much fearlessness and\r\ndetermination that the minister was astounded and sent the deputation\r\naway with the same answer as it had received from the Duke of\r\nOrleans—that he would see what could be done; and in accordance with\r\nthat intention a council of state was assembled and the superintendent\r\nof finance was summoned.\r\n\r\nThis man, named Emery, was the object of popular detestation, in the\r\nfirst place because he _was_ superintendent of finance, and every\r\nsuperintendent of finance deserved to be hated; in the second place,\r\nbecause he rather deserved the odium which he had incurred.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of a banker at Lyons named Particelli, who, after\r\nbecoming a bankrupt, chose to change his name to Emery; and Cardinal\r\nRichelieu having discovered in him great financial aptitude, had\r\nintroduced him with a strong recommendation to Louis XIII. under his\r\nassumed name, in order that he might be appointed to the post he\r\nsubsequently held.\r\n\r\n“You surprise me!” exclaimed the monarch. “I am rejoiced to hear you\r\nspeak of Monsieur d’Emery as calculated for a post which requires a man\r\nof probity. I was really afraid that you were going to force that\r\nvillain Particelli upon me.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied Richelieu, “rest assured that Particelli, the man to\r\nwhom your majesty refers, has been hanged.”\r\n\r\n“Ah; so much the better!” exclaimed the king. “It is not for nothing\r\nthat I am styled Louis the Just,” and he signed Emery’s appointment.\r\n\r\nThis was the same Emery who became eventually superintendent of\r\nfinance.\r\n\r\nHe was sent for by the ministers and he came before them pale and\r\ntrembling, declaring that his son had very nearly been assassinated the\r\nday before, near the palace. The mob had insulted him on account of the\r\nostentatious luxury of his wife, whose house was hung with red velvet\r\nedged with gold fringe. This lady was the daughter of Nicholas de\r\nCamus, who arrived in Paris with twenty francs in his pocket, became\r\nsecretary of state, and accumulated wealth enough to divide nine\r\nmillions of francs among his children and to keep an income of forty\r\nthousand for himself.\r\n\r\nThe fact was that Emery’s son had run a great chance of being\r\nsuffocated, one of the rioters having proposed to squeeze him until he\r\ngave up all the gold he had swallowed. Nothing, therefore, was settled\r\nthat day, as Emery’s head was not steady enough for business after such\r\nan occurrence.\r\n\r\nOn the next day Mathieu Molé, the chief president, whose courage at\r\nthis crisis, says the Cardinal de Retz, was equal to that of the Duc de\r\nBeaufort and the Prince de Condé—in other words, of the two men who\r\nwere considered the bravest in France—had been attacked in his turn.\r\nThe people threatened to hold him responsible for the evils that hung\r\nover them. But the chief president had replied with his habitual\r\ncoolness, without betraying either disturbance or surprise, that should\r\nthe agitators refuse obedience to the king’s wishes he would have\r\ngallows erected in the public squares and proceed at once to hang the\r\nmost active among them. To which the others had responded that they\r\nwould be glad to see the gallows erected; they would serve for the\r\nhanging of those detestable judges who purchased favor at court at the\r\nprice of the people’s misery.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. On the eleventh the queen in going to mass at Notre\r\nDame, as she always did on Saturdays, was followed by more than two\r\nhundred women demanding justice. These poor creatures had no bad\r\nintentions. They wished only to be allowed to fall on their knees\r\nbefore their sovereign, and that they might move her to compassion; but\r\nthey were prevented by the royal guard and the queen proceeded on her\r\nway, haughtily disdainful of their entreaties.\r\n\r\nAt length parliament was convoked; the authority of the king was to be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nOne day—it was the morning of the day my story begins—the king, Louis\r\nXIV., then ten years of age, went in state, under pretext of returning\r\nthanks for his recovery from the small-pox, to Notre Dame. He took the\r\nopportunity of calling out his guard, the Swiss troops and the\r\nmusketeers, and he had planted them round the Palais Royal, on the\r\nquays, and on the Pont Neuf. After mass the young monarch drove to the\r\nParliament House, where, upon the throne, he hastily confirmed not only\r\nsuch edicts as he had already passed, but issued new ones, each one,\r\naccording to Cardinal de Retz, more ruinous than the others—a\r\nproceeding which drew forth a strong remonstrance from the chief\r\npresident, Molé—whilst President Blancmesnil and Councillor Broussel\r\nraised their voices in indignation against fresh taxes.\r\n\r\nThe king returned amidst the silence of a vast multitude to the Palais\r\nRoyal. All minds were uneasy, most were foreboding, many of the people\r\nused threatening language.\r\n\r\nAt first, indeed, they were doubtful whether the king’s visit to the\r\nparliament had been in order to lighten or increase their burdens; but\r\nscarcely was it known that the taxes were to be still further\r\nincreased, when cries of “Down with Mazarin!” “Long live Broussel!”\r\n“Long live Blancmesnil!” resounded through the city. For the people had\r\nlearned that Broussel and Blancmesnil had made speeches in their\r\nbehalf, and, although the eloquence of these deputies had been without\r\navail, it had none the less won for them the people’s good-will. All\r\nattempts to disperse the groups collected in the streets, or silence\r\ntheir exclamations, were in vain. Orders had just been given to the\r\nroyal guards and the Swiss guards, not only to stand firm, but to send\r\nout patrols to the streets of Saint Denis and Saint Martin, where the\r\npeople thronged and where they were the most vociferous, when the mayor\r\nof Paris was announced at the Palais Royal.\r\n\r\nHe was shown in directly; he came to say that if these offensive\r\nprecautions were not discontinued, in two hours Paris would be under\r\narms.\r\n\r\nDeliberations were being held when a lieutenant in the guards, named\r\nComminges, made his appearance, with his clothes all torn, his face\r\nstreaming with blood. The queen on seeing him uttered a cry of surprise\r\nand asked him what was going on.\r\n\r\nAs the mayor had foreseen, the sight of the guards had exasperated the\r\nmob. The tocsin was sounded. Comminges had arrested one of the\r\nringleaders and had ordered him to be hanged near the cross of Du\r\nTrahoir; but in attempting to execute this command the soldiery were\r\nattacked in the market-place with stones and halberds; the delinquent\r\nhad escaped to the Rue des Lombards and rushed into a house. They broke\r\nopen the doors and searched the dwelling, but in vain. Comminges,\r\nwounded by a stone which had struck him on the forehead, had left a\r\npicket in the street and returned to the Palais Royal, followed by a\r\nmenacing crowd, to tell his story.\r\n\r\nThis account confirmed that of the mayor. The authorities were not in a\r\ncondition to cope with serious revolt. Mazarin endeavored to circulate\r\namong the people a report that troops had only been stationed on the\r\nquays and on the Pont Neuf, on account of the ceremonial of the day,\r\nand that they would soon withdraw. In fact, about four o’clock they\r\nwere all concentrated about the Palais Royal, the courts and ground\r\nfloors of which were filled with musketeers and Swiss guards, and there\r\nawaited the outcome of all this disturbance.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs at the very moment we introduced our\r\nreaders to the study of Cardinal Mazarin—once that of Cardinal\r\nRichelieu. We have seen in what state of mind he listened to the\r\nmurmurs from below, which even reached him in his seclusion, and to the\r\nguns, the firing of which resounded through that room. All at once he\r\nraised his head; his brow slightly contracted like that of a man who\r\nhas formed a resolution; he fixed his eyes upon an enormous clock that\r\nwas about to strike ten, and taking up a whistle of silver gilt that\r\nstood upon the table near him, he shrilled it twice.\r\n\r\nA door hidden in the tapestry opened noiselessly and a man in black\r\nsilently advanced and stood behind the chair on which Mazarin sat.\r\n\r\n“Bernouin,” said the cardinal, not turning round, for having whistled,\r\nhe knew that it was his _valet-de-chambre_ who was behind him; “what\r\nmusketeers are now within the palace?”\r\n\r\n“The Black Musketeers, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“What company?”\r\n\r\n“Tréville’s company.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any officer belonging to this company in the ante-chamber?”\r\n\r\n“Lieutenant d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“A man on whom we can depend, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Give me a uniform of one of these musketeers and help me to put it\r\non.”\r\n\r\nThe valet went out as silently as he had entered and appeared in a few\r\nminutes bringing the dress demanded.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal, in deep thought and in silence, began to take off the\r\nrobes of state he had assumed in order to be present at the sitting of\r\nparliament, and to attire himself in the military coat, which he wore\r\nwith a certain degree of easy grace, owing to his former campaigns in\r\nItaly. When he was completely dressed he said:\r\n\r\n“Send hither Monsieur d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\nThe valet went out of the room, this time by the centre door, but still\r\nas silently as before; one might have fancied him an apparition.\r\n\r\nWhen he was left alone the cardinal looked at himself in the glass with\r\na feeling of self-satisfaction. Still young—for he was scarcely\r\nforty-six years of age—he possessed great elegance of form and was\r\nabove the middle height; his complexion was brilliant and beautiful;\r\nhis glance full of expression; his nose, though large, was well\r\nproportioned; his forehead broad and majestic; his hair, of a chestnut\r\ncolor, was curled slightly; his beard, which was darker than his hair,\r\nwas turned carefully with a curling iron, a practice that greatly\r\nimproved it. After a short time the cardinal arranged his shoulder\r\nbelt, then looked with great complacency at his hands, which were most\r\nelegant and of which he took the greatest care; and throwing on one\r\nside the large kid gloves tried on at first, as belonging to the\r\nuniform, he put on others of silk only. At this instant the door\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the _valet-de-chambre_.\r\n\r\nAn officer, as he spoke, entered the apartment. He was a man between\r\nthirty-nine and forty years of age, of medium height but a very well\r\nproportioned figure; with an intellectual and animated physiognomy; his\r\nbeard black, and his hair turning gray, as often happens when people\r\nhave found life either too gay or too sad, more especially when they\r\nhappen to be of swart complexion.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan advanced a few steps into the apartment.\r\n\r\nHow perfectly he remembered his former entrance into that very room!\r\nSeeing, however, no one there except a musketeer of his own troop, he\r\nfixed his eyes upon the supposed soldier, in whose dress, nevertheless,\r\nhe recognized at the first glance the cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant remained standing in a dignified but respectful posture,\r\nsuch as became a man of good birth, who had in the course of his life\r\nbeen frequently in the society of the highest nobles.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal looked at him with a cunning rather than serious glance,\r\nyet he examined his countenance with attention and after a momentary\r\nsilence said:\r\n\r\n“You are Monsieur d’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“I am that individual,” replied the officer.\r\n\r\nMazarin gazed once more at a countenance full of intelligence, the play\r\nof which had been, nevertheless, subdued by age and experience; and\r\nD’Artagnan received the penetrating glance like one who had formerly\r\nsustained many a searching look, very different, indeed, from those\r\nwhich were inquiringly directed on him at that instant.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” resumed the cardinal, “you are to come with me, or rather, I am\r\nto go with you.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your command, my lord,” returned D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“I wish to visit in person the outposts which surround the Palais\r\nRoyal; do you suppose that there is any danger in so doing?”\r\n\r\n“Danger, my lord!” exclaimed D’Artagnan with a look of astonishment,\r\n“what danger?”\r\n\r\n“I am told that there is a general insurrection.”\r\n\r\n“The uniform of the king’s musketeers carries a certain respect with\r\nit, and even if that were not the case I would engage with four of my\r\nmen to put to flight a hundred of these clowns.”\r\n\r\n“Did you witness the injury sustained by Comminges?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Comminges is in the guards and not in the musketeers——”\r\n\r\n“Which means, I suppose, that the musketeers are better soldiers than\r\nthe guards.” The cardinal smiled as he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Every one likes his own uniform best, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Myself excepted,” and again Mazarin smiled; “for you perceive that I\r\nhave left off mine and put on yours.”\r\n\r\n“Lord bless us! this is modesty indeed!” cried D’Artagnan. “Had I such\r\na uniform as your eminence possesses, I protest I should be mightily\r\ncontent, and I would take an oath never to wear any other costume——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but for to-night’s adventure I don’t suppose my dress would have\r\nbeen a very safe one. Give me my felt hat, Bernouin.”\r\n\r\nThe valet instantly brought to his master a regimental hat with a wide\r\nbrim. The cardinal put it on in military style.\r\n\r\n“Your horses are ready saddled in their stables, are they not?” he\r\nsaid, turning to D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us set out.”\r\n\r\n“How many men does your eminence wish to escort you?”\r\n\r\n“You say that with four men you will undertake to disperse a hundred\r\nlow fellows; as it may happen that we shall have to encounter two\r\nhundred, take eight——”\r\n\r\n“As many as my lord wishes.”\r\n\r\n“I will follow you. This way—light us downstairs Bernouin.”\r\n\r\nThe valet held a wax-light; the cardinal took a key from his bureau and\r\nopening the door of a secret stair descended into the court of the\r\nPalais Royal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\nA Nightly Patrol.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes Mazarin and his party were traversing the street “Les\r\nBons Enfants” behind the theatre built by Richelieu expressly for the\r\nplay of “Mirame,” and in which Mazarin, who was an amateur of music,\r\nbut not of literature, had introduced into France the first opera that\r\nwas ever acted in that country.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the town denoted the greatest agitation. Numberless\r\ngroups paraded the streets and, whatever D’Artagnan might think of it,\r\nit was obvious that the citizens had for the night laid aside their\r\nusual forbearance, in order to assume a warlike aspect. From time to\r\ntime noises came in the direction of the public markets. The report of\r\nfirearms was heard near the Rue Saint Denis and occasionally church\r\nbells began to ring indiscriminately and at the caprice of the\r\npopulace. D’Artagnan, meantime, pursued his way with the indifference\r\nof a man upon whom such acts of folly made no impression. When he\r\napproached a group in the middle of the street he urged his horse upon\r\nit without a word of warning; and the members of the group, whether\r\nrebels or not, as if they knew with what sort of a man they had to\r\ndeal, at once gave place to the patrol. The cardinal envied that\r\ncomposure, which he attributed to the habit of meeting danger; but none\r\nthe less he conceived for the officer under whose orders he had for the\r\nmoment placed himself, that consideration which even prudence pays to\r\ncareless courage. On approaching an outpost near the Barriere des\r\nSergens, the sentinel cried out, “Who’s there?” and D’Artagnan\r\nanswered—having first asked the word of the cardinal—“Louis and\r\nRocroy.” After which he inquired if Lieutenant Comminges were not the\r\ncommanding officer at the outpost. The soldier replied by pointing out\r\nto him an officer who was conversing, on foot, his hand upon the neck\r\nof a horse on which the individual to whom he was talking sat. Here was\r\nthe officer D’Artagnan was seeking.\r\n\r\n“Here is Monsieur Comminges,” said D’Artagnan, returning to the\r\ncardinal. He instantly retired, from a feeling of respectful delicacy;\r\nit was, however, evident that the cardinal was recognized by both\r\nComminges and the other officers on horseback.\r\n\r\n“Well done, Guitant,” cried the cardinal to the equestrian; “I see\r\nplainly that, notwithstanding the sixty-four years that have passed\r\nover your head, you are still the same man, active and zealous. What\r\nwere you saying to this youngster?”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” replied Guitant, “I was observing that we live in troublous\r\ntimes and that to-day’s events are very like those in the days of the\r\nLigue, of which I heard so much in my youth. Are you aware that the mob\r\nhave even suggested throwing up barricades in the Rue Saint Denis and\r\nthe Rue Saint Antoine?”\r\n\r\n“And what was Comminges saying to you in reply, my good Guitant?”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Comminges, “I answered that to compose a Ligue only one\r\ningredient was wanting—in my opinion an essential one—a Duc de Guise;\r\nmoreover, no generation ever does the same thing twice.”\r\n\r\n“No, but they mean to make a Fronde, as they call it,” said Guitant.\r\n\r\n“And what is a Fronde?” inquired Mazarin.\r\n\r\n“My lord, Fronde is the name the discontented give to their party.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the origin of this name?”\r\n\r\n“It seems that some days since Councillor Bachaumont remarked at the\r\npalace that rebels and agitators reminded him of schoolboys\r\nslinging—qui frondent—stones from the moats round Paris, young urchins\r\nwho run off the moment the constable appears, only to return to their\r\ndiversion the instant his back is turned. So they have picked up the\r\nword and the insurrectionists are called ‘Frondeurs,’ and yesterday\r\nevery article sold was ‘a la Fronde;’ bread ‘a la Fronde,’ hats ‘a la\r\nFronde,’ to say nothing of gloves, pocket-handkerchiefs, and fans; but\r\nlisten——”\r\n\r\nAt that moment a window opened and a man began to sing:\r\n\r\n “A tempest from the Fronde Did blow to-day: I think ’twill blow Sieur\r\n Mazarin away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Insolent wretch!” cried Guitant.\r\n\r\n“My lord,” said Comminges, who, irritated by his wounds, wished for\r\nrevenge and longed to give back blow for blow, “shall I fire off a ball\r\nto punish that jester, and to warn him not to sing so much out of tune\r\nin the future?”\r\n\r\nAnd as he spoke he put his hand on the holster of his uncle’s\r\nsaddle-bow.\r\n\r\n“Certainly not! certainly not,” exclaimed Mazarin. “Diavolo! my dear\r\nfriend, you are going to spoil everything—everything is going on\r\nfamously. I know the French as well as if I had made them myself. They\r\nsing—let them pay the piper. During the Ligue, about which Guitant was\r\nspeaking just now, the people chanted nothing except the mass, so\r\neverything went to destruction. Come, Guitant, come along, and let’s\r\nsee if they keep watch at the Quinze-Vingts as at the Barriere des\r\nSergens.”\r\n\r\nAnd waving his hand to Comminges he rejoined D’Artagnan, who instantly\r\nput himself at the head of his troop, followed by the cardinal, Guitant\r\nand the rest of the escort.\r\n\r\n“Just so,” muttered Comminges, looking after Mazarin. “True, I forgot;\r\nprovided he can get money out of the people, that is all he wants.”\r\n\r\nThe street of Saint Honore, when the cardinal and his party passed\r\nthrough it, was crowded by an assemblage who, standing in groups,\r\ndiscussed the edicts of that memorable day. They pitied the young king,\r\nwho was unconsciously ruining his country, and threw all the odium of\r\nhis proceedings on Mazarin. Addresses to the Duke of Orleans and to\r\nCondé were suggested. Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in the highest\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan passed through the very midst of this discontented mob just\r\nas if his horse and he had been made of iron. Mazarin and Guitant\r\nconversed together in whispers. The musketeers, who had already\r\ndiscovered who Mazarin was, followed in profound silence. In the street\r\nof Saint Thomas-du-Louvre they stopped at the barrier distinguished by\r\nthe name of Quinze-Vingts. Here Guitant spoke to one of the subalterns,\r\nasking how matters were progressing.\r\n\r\n“Ah, captain!” said the officer, “everything is quiet hereabout—if I\r\ndid not know that something is going on in yonder house!”\r\n\r\nAnd he pointed to a magnificent hotel situated on the very spot whereon\r\nthe Vaudeville now stands.\r\n\r\n“In that hotel? it is the Hotel Rambouillet,” cried Guitant.\r\n\r\n“I really don’t know what hotel it is; all I do know is that I observed\r\nsome suspicious looking people go in there——”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed Guitant, with a burst of laughter; “those men\r\nmust be poets.”\r\n\r\n“Come, Guitant, speak, if you please, respectfully of these gentlemen,”\r\nsaid Mazarin; “don’t you know that I was in my youth a poet? I wrote\r\nverses in the style of Benserade——”\r\n\r\n“You, my lord?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I; shall I repeat to you some of my verses?”\r\n\r\n“Just as you please, my lord. I do not understand Italian.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but you understand French,” and Mazarin laid his hand upon\r\nGuitant’s shoulder. “My good, my brave Guitant, whatsoever command I\r\nmay give you in that language—in French—whatever I may order you to do,\r\nwill you not perform it?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. I have already answered that question in the affirmative;\r\nbut that command must come from the queen herself.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! ah yes!” Mazarin bit his lips as he spoke; “I know your devotion\r\nto her majesty.”\r\n\r\n“I have been a captain in the queen’s guards for twenty years,” was the\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“En route, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the cardinal; “all goes well in\r\nthis direction.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, in the meantime, had taken the head of his detachment\r\nwithout a word and with that ready and profound obedience which marks\r\nthe character of an old soldier.\r\n\r\nHe led the way toward the hill of Saint Roche. The Rue Richelieu and\r\nthe Rue Villedot were then, owing to their vicinity to the ramparts,\r\nless frequented than any others in that direction, for the town was\r\nthinly inhabited thereabout.\r\n\r\n“Who is in command here?” asked the cardinal.\r\n\r\n“Villequier,” said Guitant.\r\n\r\n“Diavolo! Speak to him yourself, for ever since you were deputed by me\r\nto arrest the Duc de Beaufort, this officer and I have been on bad\r\nterms. He laid claim to that honor as captain of the royal guards.”\r\n\r\n“I am aware of that, and I have told him a hundred times that he was\r\nwrong. The king could not give that order, since at that time he was\r\nhardly four years old.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I could give him the order—I, Guitant—and I preferred to give\r\nit to you.”\r\n\r\nGuitant, without reply, rode forward and desired the sentinel to call\r\nMonsieur de Villequier.\r\n\r\n“Ah! so you are here!” cried the officer, in the tone of ill-humor\r\nhabitual to him; “what the devil are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to know—can you tell me, pray—is anything fresh occurring in\r\nthis part of the town?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? People cry out, ‘Long live the king! down with\r\nMazarin!’ That’s nothing new; no, we’ve been used to those acclamations\r\nfor some time.”\r\n\r\n“And you sing chorus,” replied Guitant, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Faith, I’ve half a mind to do it. In my opinion the people are right;\r\nand cheerfully would I give up five years of my pay—which I am never\r\npaid, by the way—to make the king five years older.”\r\n\r\n“Really! And pray what would come to pass, supposing the king were five\r\nyears older than he is?”\r\n\r\n“As soon as ever the king comes of age he will issue his commands\r\nhimself, and ’tis far pleasanter to obey the grandson of Henry IV. than\r\nthe son of Peter Mazarin. ‘Sdeath! I would die willingly for the king,\r\nbut supposing I happened to be killed on account of Mazarin, as your\r\nnephew came near being to-day, there could be nothing in Paradise,\r\nhowever well placed I might be there, that could console me for it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, Monsieur de Villequier,” Mazarin interposed, “I shall make\r\nit my care the king hears of your loyalty. Come, gentlemen,” addressing\r\nthe troop, “let us return.”\r\n\r\n“Stop,” exclaimed Villequier, “so Mazarin was here! so much the better.\r\nI have been waiting for a long time to tell him what I think of him. I\r\nam obliged to you Guitant, although your intention was perhaps not very\r\nfavorable to me, for such an opportunity.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away and went off to his post, whistling a tune then popular\r\namong the party called the “Fronde,” whilst Mazarin returned, in a\r\npensive mood, toward the Palais Royal. All that he had heard from these\r\nthree different men, Comminges, Guitant and Villequier, confirmed him\r\nin his conviction that in case of serious tumults there would be no one\r\non his side except the queen; and then Anne of Austria had so often\r\ndeserted her friends that her support seemed most precarious. During\r\nthe whole of this nocturnal ride, during the whole time that he was\r\nendeavoring to understand the various characters of Comminges, Guitant\r\nand Villequier, Mazarin was, in truth, studying more especially one\r\nman. This man, who had remained immovable as bronze when menaced by the\r\nmob—not a muscle of whose face was stirred, either at Mazarin’s\r\nwitticisms or by the jests of the multitude—seemed to the cardinal a\r\npeculiar being, who, having participated in past events similar to\r\nthose now occurring, was calculated to cope with those now on the eve\r\nof taking place.\r\n\r\nThe name of D’Artagnan was not altogether new to Mazarin, who, although\r\nhe did not arrive in France before the year 1634 or 1635, that is to\r\nsay, about eight or nine years after the events which we have related\r\nin a preceding narrative, * fancied he had heard it pronounced as that\r\nof one who was said to be a model of courage, address and loyalty.\r\n\r\n* “The Three Musketeers.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPossessed by this idea, the cardinal resolved to know all about\r\nD’Artagnan immediately; of course he could not inquire from D’Artagnan\r\nhimself who he was and what had been his career; he remarked, however,\r\nin the course of conversation that the lieutenant of musketeers spoke\r\nwith a Gascon accent. Now the Italians and the Gascons are too much\r\nalike and know each other too well ever to trust what any one of them\r\nmay say of himself; so in reaching the walls which surrounded the\r\nPalais Royal, the cardinal knocked at a little door, and after thanking\r\nD’Artagnan and requesting him to wait in the court of the Palais Royal,\r\nhe made a sign to Guitant to follow him.\r\n\r\nThey both dismounted, consigned their horses to the lackey who had\r\nopened the door, and disappeared in the garden.\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said the cardinal, leaning, as they walked through\r\nthe garden, on his friend’s arm, “you told me just now that you had\r\nbeen twenty years in the queen’s service.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s true. I have,” returned Guitant.\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear Guitant, I have often remarked that in addition to your\r\ncourage, which is indisputable, and your fidelity, which is invincible,\r\nyou possess an admirable memory.”\r\n\r\n“You have found that out, have you, my lord? Deuce take it—all the\r\nworse for me!”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“There is no doubt but that one of the chief accomplishments of a\r\ncourtier is to know when to forget.”\r\n\r\n“But you, Guitant, are not a courtier. You are a brave soldier, one of\r\nthe few remaining veterans of the days of Henry IV. Alas! how few\r\nto-day exist!”\r\n\r\n“Plague on’t, my lord, have you brought me here to get my horoscope out\r\nof me?”\r\n\r\n“No; I only brought you here to ask you,” returned Mazarin, smiling,\r\n“if you have taken any particular notice of our lieutenant of\r\nmusketeers?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan? I have had no occasion to notice him\r\nparticularly; he’s an old acquaintance. He’s a Gascon. De Tréville\r\nknows him and esteems him very highly, and De Tréville, as you know, is\r\none of the queen’s greatest friends. As a soldier the man ranks well;\r\nhe did his whole duty and even more, at the siege of Rochelle—as at\r\nSuze and Perpignan.”\r\n\r\n“But you know, Guitant, we poor ministers often want men with other\r\nqualities besides courage; we want men of talent. Pray, was not\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan, in the time of the cardinal, mixed up in some\r\nintrigue from which he came out, according to report, quite cleverly?”\r\n\r\n“My lord, as to the report you allude to”—Guitant perceived that the\r\ncardinal wished to make him speak out—“I know nothing but what the\r\npublic knows. I never meddle in intrigues, and if I occasionally become\r\na confidant of the intrigues of others I am sure your eminence will\r\napprove of my keeping them secret.”\r\n\r\nMazarin shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” he said; “some ministers are fortunate and find out all that they\r\nwish to know.”\r\n\r\n“My lord,” replied Guitant, “such ministers do not weigh men in the\r\nsame balance; they get their information on war from warriors; on\r\nintrigues, from intriguers. Consult some politician of the period of\r\nwhich you speak, and if you pay well for it you will certainly get to\r\nknow all you want.”\r\n\r\n“Eh, pardieu!” said Mazarin, with a grimace which he always made when\r\nspoken to about money. “They will be paid, if there is no way of\r\ngetting out of it.”\r\n\r\n“Does my lord seriously wish me to name any one who was mixed up in the\r\ncabals of that day?”\r\n\r\n“By Bacchus!” rejoined Mazarin, impatiently, “it’s about an hour since\r\nI asked you for that very thing, wooden-head that you are.”\r\n\r\n“There is one man for whom I can answer, if he will speak out.”\r\n\r\n“That’s my concern; I will make him speak.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my lord, ’tis not easy to make people say what they don’t wish to\r\nlet out.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! with patience one must succeed. Well, this man. Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“The Comte de Rochefort.”\r\n\r\n“The Comte de Rochefort!”\r\n\r\n“Unfortunately he has disappeared these four or five years and I don’t\r\nknow where he is.”\r\n\r\n“I know, Guitant,” said Mazarin.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, how is it that your eminence complained just now of want\r\nof information?”\r\n\r\n“You think,” resumed Mazarin, “that Rochefort——”\r\n\r\n“He was Cardinal Richelieu’s creature, my lord. I warn you, however,\r\nhis services will cost you something. The cardinal was lavish to his\r\nunderlings.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Guitant,” said Mazarin; “Richelieu was a great man, a very\r\ngreat man, but he had that defect. Thanks, Guitant; I shall benefit by\r\nyour advice this very evening.”\r\n\r\nHere they separated and bidding adieu to Guitant in the court of the\r\nPalais Royal, Mazarin approached an officer who was walking up and down\r\nwithin that inclosure.\r\n\r\nIt was D’Artagnan, who was waiting for him.\r\n\r\n“Come hither,” said Mazarin in his softest voice; “I have an order to\r\ngive you.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan bent low and following the cardinal up the secret staircase,\r\nsoon found himself in the study whence they had first set out.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal seated himself before his bureau and taking a sheet of\r\npaper wrote some lines upon it, whilst D’Artagnan stood imperturbable,\r\nwithout showing either impatience or curiosity. He was like a soldierly\r\nautomaton, or rather, like a magnificent marionette.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal folded and sealed his letter.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” he said, “you are to take this dispatch to the\r\nBastile and bring back here the person it concerns. You must take a\r\ncarriage and an escort, and guard the prisoner with the greatest care.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan took the letter, touched his hat with his hand, turned round\r\nupon his heel like a drill-sergeant, and a moment afterward was heard,\r\nin his dry and monotonous tone, commanding “Four men and an escort, a\r\ncarriage and a horse.” Five minutes afterward the wheels of the\r\ncarriage and the horses’ shoes were heard resounding on the pavement of\r\nthe courtyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\nDead Animosities.\r\n\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan arrived at the Bastile just as it was striking half-past\r\neight. His visit was announced to the governor, who, on hearing that he\r\ncame from the cardinal, went to meet him and received him at the top of\r\nthe great flight of steps outside the door. The governor of the Bastile\r\nwas Monsieur du Tremblay, the brother of the famous Capuchin, Joseph,\r\nthat fearful favorite of Richelieu’s, who went by the name of the Gray\r\nCardinal.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that the Duc de Bassompierre passed in the\r\nBastile—where he remained for twelve long years—when his companions, in\r\ntheir dreams of liberty, said to each other: “As for me, I shall go out\r\nof the prison at such a time,” and another, at such and such a time,\r\nthe duke used to answer, “As for me, gentlemen, I shall leave only when\r\nMonsieur du Tremblay leaves;” meaning that at the death of the cardinal\r\nDu Tremblay would certainly lose his place at the Bastile and De\r\nBassompierre regain his at court.\r\n\r\nHis prediction was nearly fulfilled, but in a very different way from\r\nthat which De Bassompierre supposed; for after the death of Richelieu\r\neverything went on, contrary to expectation, in the same way as before;\r\nand Bassompierre had little chance of leaving his prison.\r\n\r\nMonsieur du Tremblay received D’Artagnan with extreme politeness and\r\ninvited him to sit down with him to supper, of which he was himself\r\nabout to partake.\r\n\r\n“I should be delighted to do so,” was the reply; “but if I am not\r\nmistaken, the words ‘In haste,’ are written on the envelope of the\r\nletter which I brought.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Du Tremblay. “Halloo, major! tell them to order\r\nNumber 25 to come downstairs.”\r\n\r\nThe unhappy wretch who entered the Bastile ceased, as he crossed the\r\nthreshold, to be a man—he became a number.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan shuddered at the noise of the keys; he remained on\r\nhorseback, feeling no inclination to dismount, and sat looking at the\r\nbars, at the buttressed windows and the immense walls he had hitherto\r\nonly seen from the other side of the moat, but by which he had for\r\ntwenty years been awe-struck.\r\n\r\nA bell resounded.\r\n\r\n“I must leave you,” said Du Tremblay; “I am sent for to sign the\r\nrelease of a prisoner. I shall be happy to meet you again, sir.”\r\n\r\n“May the devil annihilate me if I return thy wish!” murmured\r\nD’Artagnan, smiling as he pronounced the imprecation; “I declare I feel\r\nquite ill after only being five minutes in the courtyard. Go to! go to!\r\nI would rather die on straw than hoard up a thousand a year by being\r\ngovernor of the Bastile.”\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely finished this soliloquy before the prisoner arrived. On\r\nseeing him D’Artagnan could hardly suppress an exclamation of surprise.\r\nThe prisoner got into the carriage without seeming to recognize the\r\nmusketeer.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” thus D’Artagnan addressed the four musketeers, “I am\r\nordered to exercise the greatest possible care in guarding the\r\nprisoner, and since there are no locks to the carriage, I shall sit\r\nbeside him. Monsieur de Lillebonne, lead my horse by the bridle, if you\r\nplease.” As he spoke he dismounted, gave the bridle of his horse to the\r\nmusketeer and placing himself by the side of the prisoner said, in a\r\nvoice perfectly composed, “To the Palais Royal, at full trot.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage drove on and D’Artagnan, availing himself of the darkness\r\nin the archway under which they were passing, threw himself into the\r\narms of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Rochefort!” he exclaimed; “you! is it you, indeed? I am not mistaken?”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan!” cried Rochefort.\r\n\r\n“Ah! my poor friend!” resumed D’Artagnan, “not having seen you for four\r\nor five years I concluded you were dead.”\r\n\r\n“I’faith,” said Rochefort, “there’s no great difference, I think,\r\nbetween a dead man and one who has been buried alive; now I have been\r\nburied alive, or very nearly so.”\r\n\r\n“And for what crime are you imprisoned in the Bastile.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish me to speak the truth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any suspicion of me, Rochefort?”\r\n\r\n“No! on the honor of a gentleman; but I cannot be imprisoned for the\r\nreason alleged; it is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“What reason?” asked D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“For stealing.”\r\n\r\n“For stealing! you, Rochefort! you are laughing at me.”\r\n\r\n“I understand. You mean that this demands explanation, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“I admit it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, this is what actually took place: One evening after an orgy in\r\nReinard’s apartment at the Tuileries with the Duc d’Harcourt,\r\nFontrailles, De Rieux and others, the Duc d’Harcourt proposed that we\r\nshould go and pull cloaks on the Pont Neuf; that is, you know, a\r\ndiversion which the Duc d’Orleans made quite the fashion.”\r\n\r\n“Were you crazy, Rochefort? at your age!”\r\n\r\n“No, I was drunk. And yet, since the amusement seemed to me rather\r\ntame, I proposed to Chevalier de Rieux that we should be spectators\r\ninstead of actors, and, in order to see to advantage, that we should\r\nmount the bronze horse. No sooner said than done. Thanks to the spurs,\r\nwhich served as stirrups, in a moment we were perched upon the croupe;\r\nwe were well placed and saw everything. Four or five cloaks had already\r\nbeen lifted, with a dexterity without parallel, and not one of the\r\nvictims had dared to say a word, when some fool of a fellow, less\r\npatient than the others, took it into his head to cry out, ‘Guard!’ and\r\ndrew upon us a patrol of archers. Duc d’Harcourt, Fontrailles, and the\r\nothers escaped; De Rieux was inclined to do likewise, but I told him\r\nthey wouldn’t look for us where we were. He wouldn’t listen, put his\r\nfoot on the spu"

		    "text": "My Life — Volume 1, by Richard Wagner\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n1813-1842\r\n\r\n\r\nI was born at Leipzig on the 22nd of May 1813, in a room on the second\r\nfloor of the ‘Red and White Lion,’ and two days later was baptized at\r\nSt. Thomas’s Church, and christened Wilhelm Richard.\r\n\r\nMy father, Friedrich Wagner, was at the time of my birth a clerk in the\r\npolice service at Leipzig, and hoped to get the post of Chief Constable\r\nin that town, but he died in the October of that same year. His death\r\nwas partly due to the great exertions imposed upon him by the stress of\r\npolice work during the war troubles and the battle of Leipzig, and\r\npartly to the fact that he fell a victim to the nervous fever which was\r\nraging at that time. As regards his father’s position in life, I learnt\r\nlater that he had held a small civil appointment as toll collector at\r\nthe Ranstädt Gate, but had distinguished himself from those in the same\r\nstation by giving his two sons a superior education, my father,\r\nFriedrich, studying law, and the younger son, Adolph, theology.\r\n\r\nMy uncle subsequently exercised no small influence on my development;\r\nwe shall meet him again at a critical turning-point in the story of my\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nMy father, whom I had lost so early, was, as I discovered afterwards, a\r\ngreat lover of poetry and literature in general, and possessed in\r\nparticular an almost passionate affection for the drama, which was at\r\nthat time much in vogue among the educated classes. My mother told me,\r\namong other things, that he took her to Lauchstadt for the first\r\nperformance of the _Braut von Messina_, and that on the promenade he\r\npointed out Schiller and Goethe to her, and reproved her warmly for\r\nnever having heard of these great men. He is said to have been not\r\naltogether free from a gallant interest in actresses. My mother used to\r\ncomplain jokingly that she often had to keep lunch waiting for him\r\nwhile he was paying court to a certain famous actress of the day.[1]\r\nWhen she scolded him, he vowed that he had been delayed by papers that\r\nhad to be attended to, and as a proof of his assertion pointed to his\r\nfingers, which were supposed to be stained with ink, but on closer\r\ninspection were found to be quite clean. His great fondness for the\r\ntheatre was further shown by his choice of the actor, Ludwig Geyer, as\r\none of his intimate friends. Although his choice of this friend was no\r\ndoubt mainly due to his love for the theatre, he at the same time\r\nintroduced into his family the noblest of benefactors; for this modest\r\nartist, prompted by a warm interest in the lot of his friend’s large\r\nfamily, so unexpectedly left destitute, devoted the remainder of his\r\nlife to making strenuous efforts to maintain and educate the orphans.\r\nEven when the police official was spending his evenings at the theatre,\r\nthe worthy actor generally filled his place in the family circle, and\r\nit seems had frequently to appease my mother, who, rightly or wrongly,\r\ncomplained of the frivolity of her husband.\r\n\r\n [1] Madame Hartwig.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow deeply the homeless artist, hard pressed by life and tossed to and\r\nfro, longed to feel himself at home in a sympathetic family circle, was\r\nproved by the fact that a year after his friend’s death he married his\r\nwidow, and from that time forward became a most loving father to the\r\nseven children that had been left behind.\r\n\r\nIn this onerous undertaking he was favoured by an unexpected\r\nimprovement in his position, for he obtained a remunerative,\r\nrespectable, and permanent engagement, as a character actor, at the\r\nnewly established Court Theatre in Dresden. His talent for painting,\r\nwhich had already helped him to earn a livelihood when forced by\r\nextreme poverty to break off his university studies, again stood him in\r\ngood stead in his position at Dresden. True, he complained even more\r\nthan his critics that he had been kept from a regular and systematic\r\nstudy of this art, yet his extraordinary aptitude, for portrait\r\npainting in particular, secured him such important commissions that he\r\nunfortunately exhausted his strength prematurely by his twofold\r\nexertions as painter and actor. Once, when he was invited to Munich to\r\nfulfil a temporary engagement at the Court Theatre, he received,\r\nthrough the distinguished recommendation of the Saxon Court, such\r\npressing commissions from the Bavarian Court for portraits of the royal\r\nfamily that he thought it wise to cancel his contract altogether. He\r\nalso had a turn for poetry. Besides fragments—often in very dainty\r\nverse—he wrote several comedies, one of which, _Der Bethlehemitische\r\nKindermord_, in rhymed Alexandrines, was often performed; it was\r\npublished and received the warmest praise from Goethe.\r\n\r\nThis excellent man, under whose care our family moved to Dresden when I\r\nwas two years old, and by whom my mother had another daughter, Cecilia,\r\nnow also took my education in hand with the greatest care and\r\naffection. He wished to adopt me altogether, and accordingly, when I\r\nwas sent to my first school, he gave me his own name, so that till the\r\nage of fourteen I was known to my Dresden schoolfellows as Richard\r\nGeyer; and it was not until some years after my stepfather’s death, and\r\non my family’s return to Leipzig, the home of my own kith and kin, that\r\nI resumed the name of Wagner.\r\n\r\nThe earliest recollections of my childhood are associated with my\r\nstepfather, and passed from him to the theatre. I well remember that he\r\nwould have liked to see me develop a talent for painting; and his\r\nstudio, with the easel and the pictures upon it, did not fail to\r\nimpress me. I remember in particular that I tried, with a childish love\r\nof imitation, to copy a portrait of King Frederick Augustus of Saxony;\r\nbut when this simple daubing had to give place to a serious study of\r\ndrawing, I could not stand it, possibly because I was discouraged by\r\nthe pedantic technique of my teacher, a cousin of mine, who was rather\r\na bore. At one time during my early boyhood I became so weak after some\r\nchildish ailment that my mother told me later she used almost to wish\r\nme dead, for it seemed as though I should never get well. However, my\r\nsubsequent good health apparently astonished my parents. I afterwards\r\nlearnt the noble part played by my excellent stepfather on this\r\noccasion also; he never gave way to despair, in spite of the cares and\r\ntroubles of so large a family, but remained patient throughout, and\r\nnever lost the hope of pulling me through safely.\r\n\r\nMy imagination at this time was deeply impressed by my acquaintance\r\nwith the theatre, with which I was brought into contact, not only as a\r\nchildish spectator from the mysterious stagebox, with its access to the\r\nstage, and by visits to the wardrobe with its fantastic costumes, wigs\r\nand other disguises, but also by taking a part in the performances\r\nmyself. After I had been filled with fear by seeing my father play the\r\nvillain’s part in such tragedies as _Die Waise und der Mörder, Die\r\nbeiden Galeerensklaven_, I occasionally took part in comedy. I remember\r\nthat I appeared in _Der Weinberg an der Elbe_, a piece specially\r\nwritten to welcome the King of Saxony on his return from captivity,\r\nwith music by the conductor, C. M. von Weber. In this I figured in a\r\n_tableau vivant_ as an angel, sewn up in tights with wings on my back,\r\nin a graceful pose which I had laboriously practised. I also remember\r\non this occasion being given a big iced cake, which I was assured the\r\nKing had intended for me personally. Lastly, I can recall taking a\r\nchild’s part in which I had a few words to speak in Kotzebue’s\r\n_Menschenhass und Reue_[2], which furnished me with an excuse at school\r\nfor not having learnt my lessons. I said I had too much to do, as I had\r\nto learn by heart an important part in _Den Menschen ausser der\r\nReihe_.[3]\r\n\r\n [2] ‘Misanthropy and Remorse.’\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] ‘The Man out of the Rank or Row.’ In the German this is a simple\r\n phonetic corruption of Kotzebue’s title, which might easily occur to a\r\n child who had only heard, and not read, that title.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to show how seriously my father regarded my\r\neducation, when I was six years old he took me to a clergyman in the\r\ncountry at Possendorf, near Dresden, where I was to be given a sound\r\nand healthy training with other boys of my own class. In the evening,\r\nthe vicar, whose name was Wetzel, used to tell us the story of Robinson\r\nCrusoe, and discuss it with us in a highly instructive manner. I was,\r\nmoreover, much impressed by a biography of Mozart which was read aloud;\r\nand the newspaper accounts and monthly reports of the events of the\r\nGreek War of Independence stirred my imagination deeply. My love for\r\nGreece, which afterwards made me turn with enthusiasm to the mythology\r\nand history of ancient Hellas, was thus the natural outcome of the\r\nintense and painful interest I took in the events of this period. In\r\nafter years the story of the struggle of the Greeks against the\r\nPersians always revived my impressions of this modern revolt of Greece\r\nagainst the Turks.\r\n\r\nOne day, when I had been in this country home scarcely a year, a\r\nmessenger came from town to ask the vicar to take me to my parents’\r\nhouse in Dresden, as my father was dying.\r\n\r\nWe did the three hours’ journey on foot; and as I was very exhausted\r\nwhen I arrived, I scarcely understood why my mother was crying. The\r\nnext day I was taken to my father’s bedside; the extreme weakness with\r\nwhich he spoke to me, combined with all the precautions taken in the\r\nlast desperate treatment of his complaint—acute hydrothorax—made the\r\nwhole scene appear like a dream to me, and I think I was too frightened\r\nand surprised to cry.\r\n\r\nIn the next room my mother asked me to show her what I could play on\r\nthe piano, wisely hoping to divert my father’s thoughts by the sound. I\r\nplayed Ueb’ immer Treu und Redlichkeit, and my father said to her, ‘Is\r\nit possible he has musical talent?’\r\n\r\nIn the early hours of the next morning my mother came into the great\r\nnight nursery, and, standing by the bedside of each of us in turn, told\r\nus, with sobs, that our father was dead, and gave us each a message\r\nwith his blessing. To me she said, ‘He hoped to make something of you.’\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon my schoolmaster, Wetzel, came to take me back to the\r\ncountry. We walked the whole way to Possendorf, arriving at nightfall.\r\nOn the way I asked him many questions about the stars, of which he gave\r\nme my first intelligent idea.\r\n\r\nA week later my stepfather’s brother arrived from Eisleben for the\r\nfuneral. He promised, as far as he was able, to support the family,\r\nwhich was now once more destitute, and undertook to provide for my\r\nfuture education.\r\n\r\nI took leave of my companions and of the kind-hearted clergyman, and it\r\nwas for his funeral that I paid my next visit to Possendorf a few years\r\nlater. I did not go to the place again till long afterwards, when I\r\nvisited it on an excursion such as I often made, far into the country,\r\nat the time when I was conducting the orchestra in Dresden. I was much\r\ngrieved not to find the old parsonage still there, but in its place a\r\nmore pretentious modern structure, which so turned me against the\r\nlocality, that thenceforward my excursions were always made in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThis time my uncle brought me back to Dresden in the carriage. I found\r\nmy mother and sister in the deepest mourning, and remember being\r\nreceived for the first time with a tenderness not usual in our family;\r\nand I noticed that the same tenderness marked our leave-taking, when, a\r\nfew days later, my uncle took me with him to Eisleben.\r\n\r\nThis uncle, who was a younger brother of my stepfather, had settled\r\nthere as a goldsmith, and Julius, one of my elder brothers, had already\r\nbeen apprenticed to him. Our old grandmother also lived with this\r\nbachelor son, and as it was evident that she could not live long, she\r\nwas not informed of the death of her eldest son, which I, too, was\r\nbidden to keep to myself. The servant carefully removed the crape from\r\nmy coat, telling me she would keep it until my grandmother died, which\r\nwas likely to be soon.\r\n\r\nI was now often called upon to tell her about my father, and it was no\r\ngreat difficulty for me to keep the secret of his death, as I had\r\nscarcely realised it myself. She lived in a dark back room looking out\r\nupon a narrow courtyard, and took a great delight in watching the\r\nrobins that fluttered freely about her, and for which she always kept\r\nfresh green boughs by the stove. When some of these robins were killed\r\nby the cat, I managed to catch others for her in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhich pleased her very much, and, in return, she kept me tidy and\r\nclean. Her death, as had been expected, took place before long, and the\r\ncrape that had been put away was now openly worn in Eisleben.\r\n\r\nThe back room, with its robins and green branches, now knew me no more,\r\nbut I soon made myself at home with a soap-boiler’s family, to whom the\r\nhouse belonged, and became popular with them on account of the stories\r\nI told them.\r\n\r\nI was sent to a private school kept by a man called Weiss, who left an\r\nimpression of gravity and dignity upon my mind.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifties I was greatly moved at reading in a\r\nmusical paper the account of a concert at Eisleben, consisting of parts\r\nof Tannhäuser, at which my former master, who had not forgotten his\r\nyoung pupil, had been present.\r\n\r\nThe little old town with Luther’s house, and the numberless memorials\r\nit contained of his stay there, has often, in later days, come back to\r\nme in dreams. I have always wished to revisit it and verify the\r\nclearness of my recollections, but, strange to say, it has never been\r\nmy fate to do so. We lived in the market-place, where I was often\r\nentertained by strange sights, such, for instance, as performances by a\r\ntroupe of acrobats, in which a man walked a rope stretched from tower\r\nto tower across the square, an achievement which long inspired me with\r\na passion for such feats of daring. Indeed, I got so far as to walk a\r\nrope fairly easily myself with the help of a balancing-pole. I had made\r\nthe rope out of cords twisted together and stretched across the\r\ncourtyard, and even now I still feel a desire to gratify my acrobatic\r\ninstincts. The thing that attracted me most, however, was the brass\r\nband of a Hussar regiment quartered at Eisleben. It often played a\r\ncertain piece which had just come out, and which was making a great\r\nsensation, I mean the ‘Huntsmen’s Chorus’ out of the Freischutz, that\r\nhad been recently performed at the Opera in Berlin. My uncle and\r\nbrother asked me eagerly about its composer, Weber, whom I must have\r\nseen at my parents’ house in Dresden, when he was conductor of the\r\norchestra there.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Jungfernkranz was zealously played and sung by\r\nsome friends who lived near us. These two pieces cured me of my\r\nweakness for the ‘Ypsilanti’ Waltz, which till that time I had regarded\r\nas the most wonderful of compositions.\r\n\r\nI have recollections of frequent tussles with the town boys, who were\r\nconstantly mocking at me for my ‘square’ cap; and I remember, too, that\r\nI was very fond of rambles of adventure among the rocky banks of the\r\nUnstrut.\r\n\r\nMy uncle’s marriage late in life, and the starting of his new home,\r\nbrought about a marked alteration in his relations to my family.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of a year I was taken by him to Leipzig, and handed over\r\nfor some days to the Wagners, my own father’s relatives, consisting of\r\nmy uncle Adolph and his sister Friederike Wagner. This extraordinarily\r\ninteresting man, whose influence afterwards became ever more\r\nstimulating to me, now for the first time brought himself and his\r\nsingular environment into my life.\r\n\r\nHe and my aunt were very close friends of Jeannette Thome, a queer old\r\nmaid who shared with them a large house in the market-place, in which,\r\nif I am not mistaken, the Electoral family of Saxony had, ever since\r\nthe days of Augustus the Strong, hired and furnished the two principal\r\nstoreys for their own use whenever they were in Leipzig.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, Jeannette Thome really owned the second storey, of\r\nwhich she inhabited only a modest apartment looking out on the\r\ncourtyard. As, however, the King merely occupied the hired rooms for a\r\nfew days in the year, Jeannette and her circle generally made use of\r\nhis splendid apartments, and one of these staterooms was made into a\r\nbedroom for me.\r\n\r\nThe decorations and fittings of these rooms also dated from the days of\r\nAugustus the Strong. They were luxurious with heavy silk and rich\r\nrococo furniture, all of which were much soiled with age. As a matter\r\nof fact, I was delighted by these large strange rooms, looking out upon\r\nthe bustling Leipzig market-place, where I loved above all to watch the\r\nstudents in the crowd making their way along in their old-fashioned\r\n‘Club’ attire, and filling up the whole width of the street.\r\n\r\nThere was only one portion of the decorations of the rooms that I\r\nthoroughly disliked, and this consisted of the various portraits, but\r\nparticularly those of high-born dames in hooped petticoats, with\r\nyouthful faces and powdered hair. These appeared to me exactly like\r\nghosts, who, when I was alone in the room, seemed to come back to life,\r\nand filled me with the most abject fear. To sleep alone in this distant\r\nchamber, in that old-fashioned bed of state, beneath those unearthly\r\npictures, was a constant terror to me. It is true I tried to hide my\r\nfear from my aunt when she lighted me to bed in the evening with her\r\ncandle, but never a night passed in which I was not a prey to the most\r\nhorrible ghostly visions, my dread of which would leave me in a bath of\r\nperspiration.\r\n\r\nThe personality of the three chief occupants of this storey was\r\nadmirably adapted to materialise the ghostly impressions of the house\r\ninto a reality that resembled some strange fairy-tale.\r\n\r\nJeannette Thome was very small and stout; she wore a fair Titus wig,\r\nand seemed to hug to herself the consciousness of vanished beauty. My\r\naunt, her faithful friend and guardian, who was also an old maid, was\r\nremarkable for the height and extreme leanness of her person. The\r\noddity of her otherwise very pleasant face was increased by an\r\nexceedingly pointed chin.\r\n\r\nMy uncle Adolph had chosen as his permanent study a dark room in the\r\ncourtyard. There it was that I saw him for the first time, surrounded\r\nby a great wilderness of books, and attired in an unpretentious indoor\r\ncostume, the most striking feature of which was a tall, pointed felt\r\ncap, such as I had seen worn by the clown who belonged to the troupe of\r\nrope-dancers at Eisleben. A great love of independence had driven him\r\nto this strange retreat. He had been originally destined for the\r\nChurch, but he soon gave that up, in order to devote himself entirely\r\nto philological studies. But as he had the greatest dislike of acting\r\nas a professor and teacher in a regular post, he soon tried to make a\r\nmeagre livelihood by literary work. He had certain social gifts, and\r\nespecially a fine tenor voice, and appears in his youth to have been\r\nwelcome as a man of letters among a fairly wide circle of friends at\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\nOn a trip to Jena, during which he and a companion seem to have found\r\ntheir way into various musical and oratorical associations, he paid a\r\nvisit to Schiller. With this object in view, he had come armed with a\r\nrequest from the management of the Leipzig Theatre, who wanted to\r\nsecure the rights of Wallenstein, which was just finished. He told me\r\nlater of the magic impression made upon him by Schiller, with his tall\r\nslight figure and irresistibly attractive blue eyes. His only complaint\r\nwas that, owing to a well-meant trick played on him by his friend, he\r\nhad been placed in a most trying position; for the latter had managed\r\nto send Schiller a small volume of Adolph Wagner’s poems in advance.\r\n\r\nThe young poet was much embarrassed to hear Schiller address him in\r\nflattering terms on the subject of his poetry, but was convinced that\r\nthe great man was merely encouraging him out of kindness. Afterwards he\r\ndevoted himself entirely to philological studios—one of his best-known\r\npublications in that department being his Parnasso Italiano, which he\r\ndedicated to Goethe in an Italian poem. True, I have heard experts say\r\nthat the latter was written in unusually pompous Italian; but Goethe\r\nsent him a letter full of praise, as well as a silver cup from his own\r\nhousehold plate. The impression that I, as a boy of eight, conceived of\r\nAdolph Wagner, amid the surroundings of his own home, was that he was a\r\npeculiarly puzzling character.\r\n\r\nI soon had to leave the influence of this environment and was brought\r\nback to my people at Dresden. Meanwhile my family, under the guidance\r\nof my bereaved mother, had been obliged to settle down as well as they\r\ncould under the circumstances. My eldest brother Albert, who originally\r\nintended to study medicine, had, upon the advice of Weber, who had much\r\nadmired his beautiful tenor voice, started his theatrical career in\r\nBreslau. My second sister Louisa soon followed his example, and became\r\nan actress. My eldest sister Rosalie had obtained an excellent\r\nengagement at the Dresden Court Theatre, and the younger members of the\r\nfamily all looked up to her; for she was now the main support of our\r\npoor sorrowing mother. My family still occupied the same comfortable\r\nhome which my father had made for them. Some of the spare rooms were\r\noccasionally let to strangers, and Spohr was among those who at one\r\ntime lodged with us. Thanks to her great energy, and to help received\r\nfrom various sources (among which the continued generosity of the\r\nCourt, out of respect to the memory of my late stepfather, must not be\r\nforgotten), my mother managed so well in making both ends meet, that\r\neven my education did not suffer.\r\n\r\nAfter it had been decided that my sister Clara, owing to her\r\nexceedingly beautiful voice, should also go on the stage, my mother\r\ntook the greatest care to prevent me from developing any taste whatever\r\nfor the theatre. She never ceased to reproach herself for having\r\nconsented to the theatrical career of my eldest brother, and as my\r\nsecond brother showed no greater talents than those which were useful\r\nto him as a goldsmith, it was now her chief desire to see some progress\r\nmade towards the fulfilment of the hopes and wishes of my step-father,\r\n‘who hoped to make something of me.’ On the completion of my eighth\r\nyear I was sent to the Kreuz Grammar School in Dresden, where it was\r\nhoped I would study! There I was placed at the bottom of the lowest\r\nclass, and started my education under the most unassuming auspices.\r\n\r\nMy mother noted with much interest the slightest signs I might show of\r\na growing love and ability for my work. She herself, though not highly\r\neducated, always created a lasting impression on all who really learnt\r\nto know her, and displayed a peculiar combination of practical domestic\r\nefficiency and keen intellectual animation. She never gave one of her\r\nchildren any definite information concerning her antecedents. She came\r\nfrom Weissenfels, and admitted that her parents had been bakers[4]\r\nthere. Even in regard to her maiden name she always spoke with some\r\nembarrassment, and intimated that it was ‘Perthes,’ though, as we\r\nafterwards ascertained, it was in reality ‘Bertz.’ Strange to say, she\r\nhad been placed in a high-class boarding-school in Leipzig, where she\r\nhad enjoyed the advantage of the care and interest of one of ‘her\r\nfather’s influential friends,’ to whom she afterwards referred as being\r\na Weimar prince who had been very kind to her family in Weissenfels.\r\nHer education in that establishment seems to have been interrupted on\r\naccount of the sudden death of this ‘friend.’ She became acquainted\r\nwith my father at a very early age, and married him in the first bloom\r\nof her youth, he also being very young, though he already held an\r\nappointment. Her chief characteristics seem to have been a keen sense\r\nof humour and an amiable temper, so we need not suppose that it was\r\nmerely a sense of duty towards the family of a departed comrade that\r\nafterwards induced the admirable Ludwig Geyer to enter into matrimony\r\nwith her when she was no longer youthful, but rather that he was\r\nimpelled to that step by a sincere and warm regard for the widow of his\r\nfriend. A portrait of her, painted by Geyer during the lifetime of my\r\nfather, gives one a very favourable impression of what she must have\r\nbeen. Even from the time when my recollection of her is quite distinct,\r\nshe always had to wear a cap owing to some slight affection of the\r\nhead, so that I have no recollection of her as a young and pretty\r\nmother. Her trying position at the head of a numerous family (of which\r\nI was the seventh surviving member), the difficulty of obtaining the\r\nwherewithal to rear them, and of keeping up appearances on very limited\r\nresources, did not conduce to evolve that tender sweetness and\r\nsolicitude which are usually associated with motherhood. I hardly ever\r\nrecollect her having fondled me. Indeed, demonstrations of affection\r\nwere not common in our family, although a certain impetuous, almost\r\npassionate and boisterous manner always characterised our dealings.\r\nThis being so, it naturally seemed to me quite a great event when one\r\nnight I, fretful with sleepiness, looked up at her with tearful eyes as\r\nshe was taking me to bed, and saw her gaze back at me proudly and\r\nfondly, and speak of me to a visitor then present with a certain amount\r\nof tenderness.\r\n\r\n [4] According to more recent information—mill owners.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat struck me more particularly about her was the strange enthusiasm\r\nand almost pathetic manner with which she spoke of the great and of the\r\nbeautiful in Art. Under this heading, however, she would never have let\r\nme suppose that she included dramatic art, but only Poetry, Music, and\r\nPainting. Consequently, she often even threatened me with her curse\r\nshould I ever express a desire to go on the stage. Moreover, she was\r\nvery religiously inclined. With intense fervour she would often give us\r\nlong sermons about God and the divine quality in man, during which, now\r\nand again, suddenly lowering her voice in a rather funny way, she would\r\ninterrupt herself in order to rebuke one of us. After the death of our\r\nstepfather she used to assemble us all round her bed every morning,\r\nwhen one of us would read out a hymn or a part of the Church service\r\nfrom the prayer-book before she took her coffee. Sometimes the choice\r\nof the part to be read was hardly appropriate, as, for instance, when\r\nmy sister Clara on one occasion thoughtlessly read the ‘Prayer to be\r\nsaid in time of War,’ and delivered it with so much expression that my\r\nmother interrupted her, saying: ‘Oh, stop! Good gracious me! Things are\r\nnot quite so bad as that. There’s no war on at present!’\r\n\r\nIn spite of our limited means we had lively and—as they appeared to my\r\nboyish imagination—even brilliant evening parties sometimes. After the\r\ndeath of my stepfather, who, thanks to his success as a portrait\r\npainter, in the later years of his life had raised his income to what\r\nfor those days was a really decent total, many agreeable acquaintances\r\nof very good social position whom he had made during this flourishing\r\nperiod still remained on friendly terms with us, and would occasionally\r\njoin us at our evening gatherings. Amongst those who came were the\r\nmembers of the Court Theatre, who at that time gave very charming and\r\nhighly entertaining parties of their own, which, on my return to\r\nDresden later on, I found had been altogether given up.\r\n\r\nVery delightful, too, were the picnics arranged between us and our\r\nfriends at some of the beautiful spots around Dresden, for these\r\nexcursions were always brightened by a certain artistic spirit and\r\ngeneral good cheer. I remember one such outing we arranged to\r\nLoschwitz, where we made a kind of gypsy camp, in which Carl Maria von\r\nWeber played his part in the character of cook. At home we also had\r\nsome music. My sister Rosalie played the piano, and Clara was beginning\r\nto sing. Of the various theatrical performances we organised in those\r\nearly days, often after elaborate preparation, with the view of amusing\r\nourselves on the birthdays of our elders, I can hardly remember one,\r\nsave a parody on the romantic play of Sappho, by Grillparzer, in which\r\nI took part as one of the singers in the crowd that preceded Phaon’s\r\ntriumphal car. I endeavoured to revive these memories by means of a\r\nfine puppet show, which I found among the effects of my late\r\nstepfather, and for which he himself had painted some beautiful\r\nscenery. It was my intention to surprise my people by means of a\r\nbrilliant performance on this little stage. After I had very clumsily\r\nmade several puppets, and had provided them with a scanty wardrobe made\r\nfrom cuttings of material purloined from my sisters, I started to\r\ncompose a chivalric drama, in which I proposed to rehearse my puppets.\r\nWhen I had drafted the first scene, my sisters happened to discover the\r\nMS. and literally laughed it to scorn, and, to my great annoyance, for\r\na long time afterwards they chaffed me by repeating one particular\r\nsentence which I had put into the mouth of the heroine, and which\r\nwas—Ich hore schon den Ritter trapsen (‘I hear his knightly footsteps\r\nfalling’). I now returned with renewed ardour to the theatre, with\r\nwhich, even at this time, my family was in close touch. Den Freischutz\r\nin particular appealed very strongly to my imagination, mainly on\r\naccount of its ghostly theme. The emotions of terror and the dread of\r\nghosts formed quite an important factor in the development of my mind.\r\nFrom my earliest childhood certain mysterious and uncanny things\r\nexercised an enormous influence over me. If I were left alone in a room\r\nfor long, I remember that, when gazing at lifeless objects such as\r\npieces of furniture, and concentrating my attention upon them, I would\r\nsuddenly shriek out with fright, because they seemed to me alive. Even\r\nduring the latest years of my boyhood, not a night passed without my\r\nwaking out of some ghostly dream and uttering the most frightful\r\nshrieks, which subsided only at the sound of some human voice. The most\r\nsevere rebuke or even chastisement seemed to me at those times no more\r\nthan a blessed release. None of my brothers or sisters would sleep\r\nanywhere near me. They put me to sleep as far as possible away from the\r\nothers, without thinking that my cries for help would only be louder\r\nand longer; but in the end they got used even to this nightly\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this childish terror, what attracted me so strongly\r\nto the theatre—by which I mean also the stage, the rooms behind the\r\nscenes, and the dressing-rooms—was not so much the desire for\r\nentertainment and amusement such as that which impels the present-day\r\ntheatre-goers, but the fascinating pleasure of finding myself in an\r\nentirely different atmosphere, in a world that was purely fantastic and\r\noften gruesomely attractive. Thus to me a scene, even a wing,\r\nrepresenting a bush, or some costume or characteristic part of it,\r\nseemed to come from another world, to be in some way as attractive as\r\nan apparition, and I felt that contact with it might serve as a lever\r\nto lift me from the dull reality of daily routine to that delightful\r\nregion of spirits. Everything connected with a theatrical performance\r\nhad for me the charm of mystery, it both bewitched and fascinated me,\r\nand while I was trying, with the help of a few playmates, to imitate\r\nthe performance of Der Freischutz, and to devote myself energetically\r\nto reproducing the needful costumes and masks in my grotesque style of\r\npainting, the more elegant contents of my sisters’ wardrobes, in the\r\nbeautifying of which I had often seen the family occupied, exercised a\r\nsubtle charm over my imagination; nay, my heart would beat madly at the\r\nvery touch of one of their dresses.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that, as I already mentioned, our family was not\r\ngiven to outward manifestations of affection, yet the fact that I was\r\nbrought up entirely among feminine surroundings must necessarily have\r\ninfluenced the development of the sensitive side of my nature. Perhaps\r\nit was precisely because my immediate circle was generally rough and\r\nimpetuous, that the opposite characteristics of womanhood, especially\r\nsuch as were connected with the imaginary world of the theatre, created\r\na feeling of such tender longing in me.\r\n\r\nLuckily these fantastic humours, merging from the gruesome into the\r\nmawkish, were counteracted and balanced by more serious influences\r\nundergone at school at the hands of my teachers and schoolfellows. Even\r\nthere, it was chiefly the weird that aroused my keenest interest. I can\r\nhardly judge whether I had what would be called a good head for study.\r\nI think that, in general, what I really liked I was soon able to grasp\r\nwithout much effort, whereas I hardly exerted myself at all in the\r\nstudy of subjects that were uncongenial. This characteristic was most\r\nmarked in regard to arithmetic and, later on, mathematics. In neither\r\nof these subjects did I ever succeed in bringing my mind seriously to\r\nbear upon the tasks that were set me. In the matter of the Classics,\r\ntoo, I paid only just as much attention as was absolutely necessary to\r\nenable me to get a grasp of them; for I was stimulated by the desire to\r\nreproduce them to myself dramatically. In this way Greek particularly\r\nattracted me, because the stories from Greek mythology so seized upon\r\nmy fancy that I tried to imagine their heroes as speaking to me in\r\ntheir native tongue, so as to satisfy my longing for complete\r\nfamiliarity with them. In these circumstances it will be readily\r\nunderstood that the grammar of the language seemed to me merely a\r\ntiresome obstacle, and by no means in itself an interesting branch of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe fact that my study of languages was never very thorough, perhaps\r\nbest explains the fact that I was afterwards so ready to cease\r\ntroubling about them altogether. Not until much later did this study\r\nreally begin to interest me again, and that was only when I learnt to\r\nunderstand its physiological and philosophical side, as it was revealed\r\nto our modern Germanists by the pioneer work of Jakob Grimm. Then, when\r\nit was too late to apply myself thoroughly to a study which at last I\r\nhad learned to appreciate, I regretted that this newer conception of\r\nthe study of languages had not yet found acceptance in our colleges\r\nwhen I was younger.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, by my successes in philological work I managed to attract\r\nthe attention of a young teacher at the Kreuz Grammar School, a Master\r\nof Arts named Sillig, who proved very helpful to me. He often permitted\r\nme to visit him and show him my work, consisting of metric translations\r\nand a few original poems, and he always seemed very pleased with my\r\nefforts in recitation. What he thought of me may best be judged perhaps\r\nfrom the fact that he made me, as a boy of about twelve, recite not\r\nonly ‘Hector’s Farewell’ from the Iliad, but even Hamlet’s celebrated\r\nmonologue. On one occasion, when I was in the fourth form of the\r\nschool, one of my schoolfellows, a boy named Starke, suddenly fell\r\ndead, and the tragic event aroused so much sympathy, that not only did\r\nthe whole school attend the funeral, but the headmaster also ordered\r\nthat a poem should be written in commemoration of the ceremony, and\r\nthat this poem should be published. Of the various poems submitted,\r\namong which there was one by myself, prepared very hurriedly, none\r\nseemed to the master worthy of the honour which he had promised, and he\r\ntherefore announced his intention of substituting one of his own\r\nspeeches in the place of our rejected attempts. Much distressed by this\r\ndecision, I quickly sought out Professor Sillig, with the view of\r\nurging him to intervene on behalf of my poem. We thereupon went through\r\nit together. Its well-constructed and well-rhymed verses, written in\r\nstanzas of eight lines, determined him to revise the whole of it\r\ncarefully. Much of its imagery was bombastic, and far beyond the\r\nconception of a boy of my age. I recollect that in one part I had drawn\r\nextensively from the monologue in Addison’s Cato, spoken by Cato just\r\nbefore his suicide. I had met with this passage in an English grammar,\r\nand it had made a deep impression upon me. The words: ‘The stars shall\r\nfade away, the sun himself grow dim with age, and nature sink in\r\nyears,’ which, at all events, were a direct plagiarism, made Sillig\r\nlaugh—a thing at which I was a little offended. However, I felt very\r\ngrateful to him, for, thanks to the care and rapidity with which he\r\ncleared my poem of these extravagances, it was eventually accepted by\r\nthe headmaster, printed, and widely circulated.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this success was extraordinary, both on my schoolfellows\r\nand on my own family. My mother devoutly folded her hands in\r\nthankfulness, and in my own mind my vocation seemed quite a settled\r\nthing. It was clear, beyond the possibility of a doubt, that I was\r\ndestined to be a poet. Professor Sillig wished me to compose a grand\r\nepic, and suggested as a subject ‘The Battle of Parnassus,’ as\r\ndescribed by Pausanias. His reasons for this choice were based upon the\r\nlegend related by Pausanias, viz., that in the second century B.C. the\r\nMuses from Parnassus aided the combined Greek armies against the\r\ndestructive invasion of the Gauls by provoking a panic among the\r\nlatter. I actually began my heroic poem in hexameter verse, but could\r\nnot get through the first canto.\r\n\r\nNot being far enough advanced in the language to understand the Greek\r\ntragedies thoroughly in the original, my own attempts to construct a\r\ntragedy in the Greek form were greatly influenced by the fact that\r\nquite by accident I came across August Apel’s clever imitation of this\r\nstyle in his striking poems ‘Polyidos’ and ‘Aitolier.’ For my theme I\r\nselected the death of Ulysses, from a fable of Hyginus, according to\r\nwhich the aged hero is killed by his son, the offspring of his union\r\nwith Calypso. But I did not get very far with this work either, before\r\nI gave it up.\r\n\r\nMy mind became so bent upon this sort of thing, that duller studies\r\nnaturally ceased to interest me. The mythology, legends, and, at last,\r\nthe history of Greece alone attracted me.\r\n\r\nI was fond of life, merry with my companions, and always ready for a\r\njoke or an adventure. Moreover, I was constantly forming friendships,\r\nalmost passionate in their ardour, with one or the other of my\r\ncomrades, and in choosing my associates I was mainly influenced by the\r\nextent to which my new acquaintance appealed to my eccentric\r\nimagination. At one time it would be poetising and versifying that\r\ndecided my choice of a friend; at another, theatrical enterprises,\r\nwhile now and then it would be a longing for rambling and mischief.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when I reached my thirteenth year, a great change came\r\nover our family affairs. My sister Rosalie, who had become the chief\r\nsupport of our household, obtained an advantageous engagement at the\r\ntheatre in Prague, whither mother and children removed in 1820, thus\r\ngiving up the Dresden home altogether. I was left behind in Dresden, so\r\nthat I might continue to attend the Kreuz Grammar School until I was\r\nready to go up to the university. I was therefore sent to board and\r\nlodge with a family named Bohme, whose sons I had known at school, and\r\nin whose house I already felt quite at home. With my residence in this\r\nsomewhat rough, poor, and not particularly well-conducted family, my\r\nyears of dissipation began. I no longer enjoyed the quiet retirement\r\nnecessary for work, nor the gentle, spiritual influence of my sisters’\r\ncompanionship. On the contrary, I was plunged into a busy, restless\r\nlife, full of rough horseplay and of quarrels. Nevertheless, it was\r\nthere that I began to experience the influence of the gentler sex in a\r\nmanner hitherto unknown to me, as the grown-up daughters of the family\r\nand their friends often filled the scanty and narrow rooms of the\r\nhouse. Indeed, my first recollections of boyish love date from this\r\nperiod. I remember a very beautiful young girl, whose name, if I am not\r\nmistaken, was Amalie Hoffmann, coming to call at the house one Sunday.\r\nShe was charmingly dressed, and her appearance as she came into the\r\nroom literally struck me dumb with amazement. On other occasions I\r\nrecollect pretending to be too helplessly sleepy to move, so that I\r\nmight be carried up to bed by the girls, that being, as they thought,\r\nthe only remedy for my condition. And I repeated this, because I found,\r\nto my surprise, that their attention under these circumstances brought\r\nme into closer and more gratifying proximity with them.\r\n\r\nThe most important event during this year of separation from my family\r\nwas, however, a short visit I paid to them in Prague. In the middle of\r\nthe winter my mother came to Dresden, and took me hack with her to\r\nPrague for a week. Her way of travelling was quite unique. To the end\r\nof her days she preferred the more dangerous mode of travelling in a\r\nhackney carriage to the quicker journey by mail-coach, so that we spent\r\nthree whole days in the bitter cold on the road from Dresden to Prague.\r\nThe journey over the Bohemian mountains often seemed to be beset with\r\nthe greatest dangers, but happily we survived our thrilling adventures\r\nand at last arrived in Prague, where I was suddenly plunged into\r\nentirely new surroundings.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the thought of leaving Saxony on another visit to\r\nBohemia, and especially Prague, had had quite a romantic attraction for\r\nme. The foreign nationality, the broken German of the people, the\r\npeculiar headgear of the women, the native wines, the harp-girls and\r\nmusicians, and finally, the ever present signs of Catholicism, its\r\nnumerous chapels and shrines, all produced on me a strangely\r\nexhilarating impression. This was probably due to my craze for\r\neverything theatrical and spectacular, as distinguished from simple\r\nbourgeois customs. Above all, the antique splendour and beauty of the\r\nincomparable city of Prague became indelibly stamped on my fancy. Even\r\nin my own family surroundings I found attractions to which I had\r\nhitherto been a stranger. For instance, my sister Ottilie, only two\r\nyears older than myself, had won the devoted friendship of a noble\r\nfamily, that of Count Pachta, two of whose daughters, Jenny and\r\nAuguste, who had long been famed as the leading beauties of Prague, had\r\nbecome fondly attached to her. To me, such people and such a connection\r\nwere something quite novel and enchanting. Besides these, certain beaux\r\nesprits of Prague, among them W. Marsano, a strikingly handsome and\r\ncharming man, were frequent visitors at our house. They often earnestly\r\ndiscussed the tales of Hoffmann, which at that date were comparatively\r\nnew, and had created some sensation. It was now that I made my first\r\nthough rather superficial acquaintance with this romantic visionary,\r\nand so received a stimulus which influenced me for many years even to\r\nthe point of infatuation, and gave me very peculiar ideas of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring, 1827, I repeated this journey from Dresden to\r\nPrague, but this time on foot, and accompanied by my friend Rudolf\r\nBohme. Our tour was full of adventure. We got to within an hour of\r\nTeplitz the first night, and next day we had to get a lift in a wagon,\r\nas we had walked our feet sore; yet this only took us as far as\r\nLowositz, as our funds had quite run out. Under a scorching sun, hungry\r\nand half-fainting, we wandered along bypaths through absolutely unknown\r\ncountry, until at sundown we happened to reach the main road just as an\r\nelegant travelling coach came in sight. I humbled my pride so far as to\r\npretend I was a travelling journeyman, and begged the distinguished\r\ntravellers for alms, while my friend timidly hid himself in the ditch\r\nby the roadside. Luckily we decided to seek shelter for the night in an\r\ninn, where we took counsel whether we should spend the alms just\r\nreceived on a supper or a bed. We decided for the supper, proposing to\r\nspend the night under the open sky. While we were refreshing ourselves,\r\na strange-looking wayfarer entered. He wore a black velvet skull-cap,\r\nto which a metal lyre was attached like a cockade, and on his back he\r\nbore a harp. Very cheerfully he set down his instrument, made himself\r\ncomfortable, and called for a good meal. He intended to stay the night,\r\nand to continue his way next day to Prague, where he lived, and whither\r\nhe was returning from Hanover.\r\n\r\nMy good spirits and courage were stimulated by the jovial manners of\r\nthis merry fellow, who constantly repeated his favourite motto, ‘non\r\nplus ultra.’ We soon struck up an acquaintance, and in return for my\r\nconfidence, the strolling player’s attitude to me was one of almost\r\ntouching sympathy. It was agreed that we should continue our journey\r\ntogether next day on foot. He lent me two twenty-kreutzer pieces (about\r\nninepence), and allowed me to write my Prague address in his\r\npocket-book. I was highly delighted at this personal success. My\r\nharpist grew extravagantly merry; a good deal of Czernosek wine was\r\ndrunk; he sang and played on his harp like a madman, continually\r\nreiterating his ‘non plus ultra’ till at last, overcome with wine, he\r\nfell down on the straw, which had been spread out on the floor for our\r\ncommon bed. When the sun once more peeped in, we could not rouse him,\r\nand we had to make up our minds to set off in the freshness of the\r\nearly morning without him, feeling convinced that the sturdy fellow\r\nwould overtake us during the day. But it was in vain that we looked out\r\nfor him on the road and during our subsequent stay in Prague. Indeed,\r\nit was not until several weeks later that the extraordinary fellow\r\nturned up at my mother’s, not so much to collect payment of his loan,\r\nas to inquire about the welfare of the young friend to whom that loan\r\nhad been made.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our journey was very fatiguing, and the joy I felt\r\nwhen I at last beheld Prague from the summit of a hill, at about an\r\nhour’s distance, simply beggars description. Approaching the suburbs,\r\nwe were for the second time met by a splendid carriage, from which my\r\nsister Ottilie’s two lovely friends called out to me in astonishment.\r\nThey had recognised me immediately, in spite of my terribly sunburnt\r\nface, blue linen blouse, and br"

		    "text": "Pride and prejudice, by Jane Austen\r\n\r\nChapter I.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\r\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\r\n\r\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\r\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\r\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\r\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that\r\nNetherfield Park is let at last?”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\r\n\r\n“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\r\ntold me all about it.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“He came down to see the place”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\nThis was invitation enough.\r\n\r\n“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\r\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\r\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\r\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\r\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\r\nin the house by the end of next week.”\r\n\r\n“What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“Bingley.”\r\n\r\n“Is he married or single?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\r\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”\r\n\r\n“How so? how can it affect them?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You\r\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Is that his design in settling here?”\r\n\r\n“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\r\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\r\nsoon as he comes.”\r\n\r\n“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\r\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\r\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\r\nparty.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\r\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\r\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”\r\n\r\n“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\r\nthe neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\r\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\r\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\r\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\r\nhim, if you do not.”\r\n\r\n“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\r\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\r\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\r\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\r\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\r\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”\r\n\r\n“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he: “they are\r\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\r\nquickness than her sisters.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\r\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.”\r\n\r\n“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\r\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\r\nthese twenty years at least.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”\r\n\r\n“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\r\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\n“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\r\nvisit them.”\r\n\r\n“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\r\nall.”\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\r\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\r\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\r\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\r\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\r\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\r\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He\r\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\r\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\r\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\r\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\r\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\r\n\r\n“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”\r\n\r\n“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother,\r\nresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”\r\n\r\n“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the\r\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.”\r\n\r\n“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\r\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\r\nof her.”\r\n\r\n“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do\r\nnot depend on her serving you.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\r\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\r\n\r\n“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven’s sake! Have a little\r\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”\r\n\r\n“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times\r\nthem ill.”\r\n\r\n“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty, fretfully. “When\r\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow fortnight.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back till\r\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\r\nshe will not know him herself.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\r\nMr. Bingley to _her_.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\r\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?”\r\n\r\n“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly\r\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\r\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\r\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\r\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\r\nwill take it on myself.”\r\n\r\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,\r\nnonsense!”\r\n\r\n“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do\r\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\r\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\r\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\r\ngreat books, and make extracts.”\r\n\r\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\r\n\r\n“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.\r\nBingley.”\r\n\r\n“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\r\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\r\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\r\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.”\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\r\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\r\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\r\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\r\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\r\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\r\nword about it till now.”\r\n\r\n“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,\r\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.\r\n\r\n“What an excellent father you have, girls,” said she, when the door was\r\nshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;\r\nor me either, for that matter. At our time of life, it is not so\r\npleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but\r\nfor your sakes we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_\r\nthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next\r\nball.”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Lydia, stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the\r\nyoungest, I’m the tallest.”\r\n\r\nThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would\r\nreturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I’m the tallest”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     “He rode a black horse”\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five\r\ndaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her\r\nhusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him\r\nin various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\r\ndistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at\r\nlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,\r\nLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been\r\ndelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely\r\nagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly\r\nwith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of\r\ndancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively\r\nhopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.\r\n\r\n“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”\r\nsaid Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well\r\nmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”\r\n\r\nIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about ten\r\nminutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being\r\nadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard\r\nmuch; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more\r\nfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper\r\nwindow, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.\r\n\r\nAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had\r\nMrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her\r\nhousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley\r\nwas obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to\r\naccept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite\r\ndisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town\r\nso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that\r\nhe might always be flying about from one place to another, and never\r\nsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a\r\nlittle by starting the idea of his\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     “When the Party entered”\r\n\r\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\r\n\r\nbeing gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a\r\nreport soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and\r\nseven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a\r\nnumber of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing\r\nthat, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,\r\nhis five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the\r\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\r\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\r\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\r\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\r\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\r\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\r\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\r\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\r\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\r\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\r\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\r\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\r\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\r\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\r\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\r\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\r\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\r\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\r\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\r\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\r\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\r\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\r\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\r\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\r\nAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\r\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\r\nhaving slighted one of "

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\r\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\r\nof my undertaking.\r\n\r\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\r\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\r\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this\r\nfeeling? This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\r\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\r\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\r\nand vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\r\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\r\nregion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\r\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\r\nperpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\r\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\r\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\r\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\r\nglobe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the\r\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\r\nsolitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I\r\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\r\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\r\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I\r\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\r\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\r\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\r\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\r\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\r\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\r\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\r\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\r\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\r\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\r\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\r\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\r\n\r\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\r\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\r\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\r\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\r\neye. This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\r\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\r\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\r\nthrough the seas which surround the pole. You may remember that a\r\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\r\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library. My education was neglected,\r\nyet I was passionately fond of reading. These volumes were my study\r\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\r\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\r\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\r\n\r\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\r\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also\r\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\r\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\r\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated. You are well\r\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\r\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\r\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\r\n\r\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I\r\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\r\ngreat enterprise. I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I\r\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\r\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\r\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\r\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\r\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\r\nthe greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself as an\r\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\r\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\r\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\r\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\r\n\r\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\r\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\r\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\r\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\r\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\r\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\r\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\r\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\r\n\r\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia. They fly\r\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\r\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach. The\r\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\r\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\r\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\r\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. I have no\r\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\r\nArchangel.\r\n\r\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\r\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\r\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\r\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\r\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\r\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\r\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\r\nor never.\r\n\r\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\r\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\r\nlove and kindness.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\n\r\nR. Walton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter 2\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\r\n\r\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\r\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a\r\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\r\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\r\npossessed of dauntless courage.\r\n\r\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\r\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\r\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\r\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\r\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\r\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\r\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\r\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\r\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\r\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\r\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\r\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\r\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\r\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\r\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\r\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\r\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\r\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\r\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\r\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\r\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\r\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\r\ncall it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\r\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\r\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\r\n\r\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\r\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\r\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\r\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\r\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\r\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\r\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\r\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\r\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\r\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\r\nin my enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\r\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\r\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\r\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\r\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\r\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\r\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\r\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\r\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\r\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\r\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\r\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\r\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\r\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\r\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\r\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\r\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\r\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\r\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\r\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\r\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\r\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\r\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\r\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\r\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\r\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\r\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\r\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\r\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\r\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\r\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\r\notherwise he would command.\r\n\r\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\r\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\r\nwavering in my resolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\r\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. The\r\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\r\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\r\nsooner than I expected. I shall do nothing rashly: you know me\r\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\r\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\r\nundertaking. It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\r\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\r\nI am preparing to depart. I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\r\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\r\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\r\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.” You will smile at my allusion, but I\r\nwill disclose a secret. I have often attributed my attachment to, my\r\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\r\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets. There is something\r\nat work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically\r\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\r\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\r\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\r\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\r\nregions I am about to explore.\r\n\r\nBut to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after\r\nhaving traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of\r\nAfrica or America? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to\r\nlook on the reverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to\r\nme by every opportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when\r\nI need them most to support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. \r\nRemember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate brother,\r\n Robert Walton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter 3\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\r\n\r\nJuly 7th, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear Sister,\r\n\r\nI write a few lines in haste to say that I am safe—and well advanced\r\non my voyage. This letter will reach England by a merchantman now on\r\nits homeward voyage from Archangel; more fortunate than I, who may not\r\nsee my native land, perhaps, for many years. I am, however, in good\r\nspirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\r\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\r\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\r\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\r\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\r\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\r\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\r\nletter. One or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are\r\naccidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and\r\nI shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my dear Margaret. Be assured that for my own sake, as well as\r\nyours, I will not rashly encounter danger. I will be cool,\r\npersevering, and prudent.\r\n\r\nBut success _shall_ crown my endeavours. Wherefore not? Thus far I\r\nhave gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars\r\nthemselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. Why not\r\nstill proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? What can stop the\r\ndetermined heart and resolved will of man?\r\n\r\nMy swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. But I must\r\nfinish. Heaven bless my beloved sister!\r\n\r\nR.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter 4\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Mrs. Saville, England._\r\n\r\nAugust 5th, 17—.\r\n\r\nSo strange an accident has happened to us that I cannot forbear\r\nrecording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before\r\nthese papers can come into your possession.\r\n\r\nLast Monday (July 31st) we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed\r\nin the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which\r\nshe floated. Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\r\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog. We accordingly lay to,\r\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\r\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\r\nhave no end. Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\r\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\r\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\r\nsituation. We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\r\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\r\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\r\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs. We watched the rapid progress\r\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\r\ndistant inequalities of the ice.\r\n\r\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\r\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\r\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\r\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\r\ngreatest attention.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\r\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\r\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\r\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\r\nrest for a few hours.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\r\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\r\ntalking to someone in the sea. It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\r\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\r\nfragment of ice. Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\r\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\r\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\r\nsome undiscovered island, but a European. When I appeared on deck the\r\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\r\non the open sea.”\r\n\r\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\r\nforeign accent. “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\r\n“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\r\n\r\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\r\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\r\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\r\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. I\r\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\r\nnorthern pole.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\r\nGood God! Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\r\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless. His limbs were\r\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\r\nsuffering. I never saw a man in so wretched a condition. We attempted\r\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\r\nair he fainted. We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\r\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\r\nswallow a small quantity. As soon as he showed signs of life we\r\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\r\nkitchen stove. By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\r\nwhich restored him wonderfully.\r\n\r\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\r\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. When he\r\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\r\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit. I never saw a more\r\ninteresting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of\r\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\r\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\r\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\r\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled. But he\r\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\r\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\r\n\r\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\r\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\r\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\r\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\r\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\r\nin so strange a vehicle.\r\n\r\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\r\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\r\n\r\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\r\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\r\n\r\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\r\nquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\r\npursued. Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\r\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\r\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\r\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\r\n\r\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\r\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\r\n\r\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\r\nice had destroyed the other sledge. I replied that I could not answer\r\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\r\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\r\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.\r\n\r\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\r\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\r\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\r\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\r\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\r\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.\r\n\r\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\r\npresent day. The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\r\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\r\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\r\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\r\nwith him. For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\r\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. He must\r\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\r\nso attractive and amiable.\r\n\r\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\r\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\r\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\r\nof my heart.\r\n\r\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\r\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 13th, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy affection for my guest increases every day. He excites at once my\r\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. How can I see so\r\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\r\ngrief? He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\r\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\r\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\r\n\r\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\r\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\r\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\r\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\r\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\r\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\r\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\r\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\r\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\r\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\r\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\r\nenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\r\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\r\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\r\ndark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\r\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\r\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\r\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\r\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\r\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\r\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”\r\n\r\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\r\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\r\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\r\nnecessary to restore his composure.\r\n\r\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\r\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\r\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\r\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\r\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\r\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\r\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\r\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\r\n\r\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\r\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\r\nourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\r\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\r\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\r\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\r\ndespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life\r\nanew.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\r\ngrief that touched me to the heart. But he was silent and presently\r\nretired to his cabin.\r\n\r\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\r\ndoes the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\r\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\r\nelevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he\r\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\r\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\r\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\r\n\r\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\r\nwanderer? You would not if you saw him. You have been tutored and\r\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\r\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\r\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. Sometimes I\r\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\r\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew. I\r\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\r\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\r\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\r\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust 19th, 17—.\r\n\r\n\r\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\r\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. I had\r\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\r\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination. You seek for\r\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\r\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\r\nhas been. I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\r\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\r\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\r\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\r\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\r\nin case of failure. Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\r\ndeemed marvellous. Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\r\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\r\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\r\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\r\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\r\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”\r\n\r\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\r\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\r\na recital of his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\r\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\r\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. I expressed\r\nthese feelings in my answer.\r\n\r\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is\r\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. I wait but for one event, and then I\r\nshall repose in peace. I understand your feeling,” continued he,\r\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my\r\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\r\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\r\ndetermined.”\r\n\r\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\r\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\r\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\r\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\r\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\r\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\r\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and\r\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\r\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\r\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\r\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\r\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\r\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 1\r\n\r\n\r\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\r\ndistinguished of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years\r\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\r\nsituations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who\r\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\r\nbusiness. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\r\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\r\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\r\nhusband and the father of a family.\r\n\r\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\r\nrefrain from relating them. One of his most intimate friends was a\r\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\r\nmischances, into poverty. This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\r\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\r\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\r\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence. Having paid his debts,\r\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\r\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\r\nwretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\r\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\r\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\r\nso little worthy of the affection that united them. He lost no time in\r\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\r\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\r\n\r\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\r\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\r\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\r\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\r\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\r\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\r\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\r\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\r\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\r\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\r\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\r\n\r\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\r\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\r\nthere was no other prospect of support. But Caroline Beaufort\r\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\r\nher in her adversity. She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\r\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\r\nsupport life.\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed in this manner. Her father grew worse; her time\r\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\r\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\r\nher an orphan and a beggar. This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\r\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\r\nchamber. He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\r\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\r\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\r\nrelation. Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\r\n\r\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\r\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\r\naffection. There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\r\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\r\nstrongly. Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\r\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\r\na greater value on tried worth. There was a show of gratitude and\r\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\r\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\r\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\r\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\r\nto his behaviour to her. Everything was made to yield to her wishes\r\nand her convenience. He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\r\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\r\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\r\nbenevolent mind. Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\r\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. During\r\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\r\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\r\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\r\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\r\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\r\n\r\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\r\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\r\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\r\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\r\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\r\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\r\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\r\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\r\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\r\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\r\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\r\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\r\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\r\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\r\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\r\none train of enjoyment to me.\r\n\r\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\r\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\r\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\r\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\r\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\r\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\r\npassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\r\nrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\r\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\r\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\r\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\r\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\r\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\r\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\r\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\r\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\r\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\r\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\r\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\r\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\r\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\r\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\r\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\r\n\r\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\r\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\r\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\r\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\r\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\r\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\r\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\r\nof Italy—one among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\r\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\r\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\r\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\r\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\r\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\r\n\r\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\r\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\r\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\r\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\r\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\r\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\r\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\r\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\r\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\r\nbecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\r\nsister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\r\nmy pleasures.\r\n\r\nEveryone loved Elizabeth. The passionate and almost reverential\r\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\r\npride and my delight. On the evening previous to her being brought to\r\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\r\nVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.” And when, on the morrow, she\r\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\r\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\r\nas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish. All praises bestowed on\r\nher I received as made to a possession of my own. We called each other\r\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin. No word, no expression could body\r\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than\r\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\r\nour ages. I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\r\ndisunion or dispute. Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\r\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\r\nnearer together. Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\r\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\r\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\r\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\r\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\r\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\r\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\r\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\r\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\r\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\r\ncauses. The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\r\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\r\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\r\nearliest sensations I can remember.\r\n\r\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\r\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\r\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a _campagne_ on Belrive,\r\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\r\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\r\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\r\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\r\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\r\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\r\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\r\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\r\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. He\r\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\r\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\r\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\r\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\r\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\r\nof the infidels.\r\n\r\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. My\r\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\r\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\r\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\r\nwhich we enjoyed. When I mingled with other families I distinctly\r\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\r\nthe development of filial love.\r\n\r\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\r\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\r\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\r\nindiscriminately. I confess that neither the structure of languages,\r\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\r\npossessed attractions for me. It was the secrets of heaven and earth\r\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\r\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\r\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\r\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\r\nrelations of things. The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\r\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\r\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\r\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. The saintly soul\r\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\r\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\r\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. She was\r\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\r\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\r\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. And\r\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval? Yet\r\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\r\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\r\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\r\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\r\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\r\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\r\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\r\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\r\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\r\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\r\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\r\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\r\n\r\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\r\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\r\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\r\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\r\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\r\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\r\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\r\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\r\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\r\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\r\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\r\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”\r\n\r\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\r\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\r\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\r\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\r\nthose of the former were real and prac"

		    "text": "Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\r\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\r\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\r\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\r\n“without pictures or conversations?”\r\n\r\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\r\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\r\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\r\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\r\nclose by her.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\r\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\r\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\r\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\r\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\r\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\r\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\r\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\r\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\r\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\r\n\r\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\r\nin the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\r\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\r\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\r\ndeep well.\r\n\r\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\r\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\r\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\r\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\r\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\r\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\r\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\r\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\r\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\r\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\r\ncupboards as she fell past it.\r\n\r\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\r\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\r\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\r\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\r\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\r\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\r\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\r\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\r\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\r\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\r\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\r\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\r\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\r\ngrand words to say.)\r\n\r\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\r\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\r\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\r\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\r\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\r\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\r\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\r\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\r\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\r\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\r\n\r\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\r\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\r\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\r\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\r\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\r\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\r\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\r\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\r\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\r\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\r\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\r\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\r\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\r\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\r\nthe fall was over.\r\n\r\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\r\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\r\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\r\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\r\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\r\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\r\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\r\nfrom the roof.\r\n\r\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\r\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\r\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\r\nget out again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\r\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\r\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\r\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\r\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\r\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\r\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\r\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\r\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\r\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\r\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\r\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\r\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\r\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\r\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\r\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\r\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\r\nindeed were really impossible.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\r\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\r\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\r\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\r\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\r\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\r\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\r\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\r\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\r\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\r\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\r\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\r\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\r\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\r\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\r\nsooner or later.\r\n\r\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\r\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\r\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\r\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\r\ntelescope.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\r\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\r\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\r\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\r\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\r\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\r\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\r\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\r\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\r\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\r\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\r\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\r\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\r\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\r\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\r\nsat down and cried.\r\n\r\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\r\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\r\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\r\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\r\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\r\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\r\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\r\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\r\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\r\nperson!”\r\n\r\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\r\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\r\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\r\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\r\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\r\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\r\n\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\r\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\r\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\r\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\r\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\r\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\r\non in the common way.\r\n\r\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nThe Pool of Tears\r\n\r\n\r\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\r\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\r\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\r\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\r\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\r\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\r\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\r\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\r\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\r\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\r\nChristmas.”\r\n\r\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\r\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\r\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\r\n\r\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\r\n     Alice’s love_).\r\n\r\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\r\n\r\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\r\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\r\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n\r\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\r\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\r\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\r\n\r\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\r\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\r\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\r\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\r\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\r\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\r\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\r\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\r\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\r\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\r\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\r\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\r\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\r\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\r\n\r\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\r\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\r\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\r\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\r\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\r\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\r\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\r\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\r\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\r\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\r\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\r\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\r\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\r\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\r\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\r\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\r\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\r\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\r\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\r\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\r\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\r\n\r\n“How doth the little crocodile\r\n    Improve his shining tail,\r\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\r\n    On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n    How neatly spread his claws,\r\nAnd welcome little fishes in\r\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\r\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\r\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\r\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\r\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\r\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\r\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\r\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\r\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\r\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\r\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\r\n\r\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\r\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\r\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\r\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\r\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\r\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\r\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\r\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\r\n\r\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\r\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\r\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\r\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\r\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\r\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\r\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\r\n\r\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\r\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\r\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\r\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\r\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\r\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\r\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\r\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\r\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\r\nshe was nine feet high.\r\n\r\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\r\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\r\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\r\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\r\n\r\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\r\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\r\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\r\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\r\nslipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\r\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\r\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\r\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\r\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\r\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\r\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\r\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\r\nbut it said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\r\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\r\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\r\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\r\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\r\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\r\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\r\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\r\ncats.”\r\n\r\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\r\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\r\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\r\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\r\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\r\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\r\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\r\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\r\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\r\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\r\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\r\n\r\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\r\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\r\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\r\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\r\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\r\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\r\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\r\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\r\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\r\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\r\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\r\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\r\npool as it went.\r\n\r\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\r\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\r\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\r\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\r\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\r\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\r\n\r\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\r\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\r\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\r\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\r\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\r\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\r\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\r\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\r\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\r\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\r\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\r\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\r\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\r\n\r\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\r\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\r\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\r\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\r\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\r\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\r\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\r\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\r\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\r\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\r\nyou speak?”\r\n\r\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\r\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\r\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\r\n\r\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\r\n\r\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\r\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\r\n\r\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\r\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\r\narchbishop find?”\r\n\r\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\r\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\r\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\r\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\r\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\r\n\r\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\r\ndry me at all.”\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\r\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\r\nremedies—”\r\n\r\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\r\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\r\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\r\ntittered audibly.\r\n\r\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\r\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\r\n\r\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\r\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\r\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\r\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\r\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\r\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\r\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\r\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\r\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\r\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\r\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\r\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\r\n\r\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\r\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\r\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\r\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\r\n\r\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\r\n\r\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\r\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\r\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\r\n\r\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\r\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\r\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\r\none a-piece, all round.\r\n\r\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\r\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\r\n\r\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\r\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\r\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\r\ncheered.\r\n\r\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\r\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\r\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\r\nshe could.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\r\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\r\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\r\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\r\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\r\n\r\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\r\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\r\nwould be offended again.\r\n\r\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\r\nsighing.\r\n\r\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\r\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\r\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\r\ntale was something like this:—\r\n\r\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\r\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\r\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\r\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\r\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\r\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\r\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\r\n\r\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\r\nyou thinking of?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\r\nbend, I think?”\r\n\r\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\r\n\r\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\r\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\r\n\r\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\r\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\r\nyou know!”\r\n\r\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\r\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\r\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\r\n\r\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\r\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\r\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\r\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\r\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\r\n\r\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\r\n\r\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\r\nLory.\r\n\r\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\r\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\r\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\r\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\r\n\r\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\r\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\r\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\r\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\r\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\r\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\r\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\r\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\r\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\r\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\r\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\r\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\r\ncoming back to finish his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\r\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\r\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\r\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\r\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\r\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\r\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\r\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\r\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\r\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\r\n\r\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\r\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\r\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\r\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\r\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\r\nmistake it had made.\r\n\r\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\r\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\r\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\r\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\r\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\r\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\r\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\r\nfan and gloves.\r\n\r\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\r\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\r\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\r\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\r\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\r\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\r\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\r\n\r\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\r\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\r\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\r\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\r\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\r\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\r\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\r\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\r\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\r\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\r\n\r\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\r\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\r\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\r\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\r\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\r\ndrunk quite so much!”\r\n\r\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\r\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\r\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\r\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\r\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\r\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\r\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\r\n\r\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\r\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\r\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\r\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\r\n\r\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\r\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\r\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\r\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\r\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\r\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\r\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\r\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\r\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\r\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\r\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\r\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\r\nfor any lesson-books!”\r\n\r\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\r\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\r\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\r\n\r\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\r\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\r\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\r\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\r\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\r\n\r\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\r\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\r\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\r\ngo round and get in at the window.”\r\n\r\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\r\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\r\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\r\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\r\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\r\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\r\n\r\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\r\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\r\nfor apples, yer honour!”\r\n\r\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\r\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\r\n\r\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\r\n\r\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\r\nwindow!”\r\n\r\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\r\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\r\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\r\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\r\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\r\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\r\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\r\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\r\n\r\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\r\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\r\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\r\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\r\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\r\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\r\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\r\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\r\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\r\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\r\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\r\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\r\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\r\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\r\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\r\n\r\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\r\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\r\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\r\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\r\nto see what would happen next.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\r\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\r\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\r\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\r\nus all about it!”\r\n\r\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\r\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\r\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\r\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\r\n\r\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\r\n\r\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\r\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\r\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\r\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\r\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\r\n\r\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\r\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\r\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\r\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\r\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\r\n\r\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\r\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\r\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\r\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\r\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\r\n\r\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\r\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\r\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\r\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\r\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\nsafe in a thick wood.\r\n\r\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\r\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\r\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\r\nwill be the best plan.”\r\n\r\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\r\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\r\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\r\ngreat hurry.\r\n\r\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\r\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\r\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\r\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\r\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\r\nspite of all her coaxing.\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\r\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\r\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\r\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\r\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\r\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\r\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\r\n\r\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\r\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\r\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\r\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\r\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\r\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\r\nquestion is, what?”\r\n\r\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\r\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\r\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\nwas on the top of it.\r\n\r\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\r\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\r\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\r\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\r\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\r\n\r\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\r\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\r\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\r\nchanged several times since then.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\r\nyourself!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\r\nnot myself, you see.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\r\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\r\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\r\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\r\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\r\nqueer, won’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\r\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\r\n\r\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\r\n\r\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\r\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\r\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\r\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\r\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\r\nstate of mind, she turned away.\r\n\r\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\r\nimportant to say!”\r\n\r\nThis sou"

		    "text": "The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light\r\nsummer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through\r\nthe open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate\r\nperfume of the pink-flowering thorn.\r\n\r\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was\r\nlying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry\r\nWotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured\r\nblossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to\r\nbear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then\r\nthe fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long\r\ntussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,\r\nproducing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of\r\nthose pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of\r\nan art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\r\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their\r\nway through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous\r\ninsistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine,\r\nseemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London\r\nwas like the bourdon note of a distant organ.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the\r\nfull-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty,\r\nand in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist\r\nhimself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago\r\ncaused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many\r\nstrange conjectures.\r\n\r\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so\r\nskilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his\r\nface, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and\r\nclosing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought\r\nto imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he\r\nmight awake.\r\n\r\n“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,” said\r\nLord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\r\nGrosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have\r\ngone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been\r\nable to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that\r\nI have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor\r\nis really the only place.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered, tossing his head\r\nback in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at\r\nOxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through\r\nthe thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls\r\nfrom his heavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear\r\nfellow, why? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You\r\ndo anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one,\r\nyou seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is\r\nonly one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is\r\nnot being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above\r\nall the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if\r\nold men are ever capable of any emotion.”\r\n\r\n“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can’t exhibit\r\nit. I have put too much of myself into it.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\r\n\r\n“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\r\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\r\nyour rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young\r\nAdonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why,\r\nmy dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an\r\nintellectual expression and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends\r\nwhere an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode\r\nof exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one\r\nsits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something\r\nhorrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.\r\nHow perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But\r\nthen in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\r\nage of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen,\r\nand as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.\r\nYour mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but\r\nwhose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of\r\nthat. He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here\r\nin winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer\r\nwhen we want something to chill our intelligence. Don’t flatter\r\nyourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am\r\nnot like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to\r\nlook like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth.\r\nThere is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\r\nthe sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering\r\nsteps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows.\r\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit\r\nat their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory,\r\nthey are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all\r\nshould live—undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They\r\nneither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.\r\nYour rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are—my art,\r\nwhatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks—we shall all suffer\r\nfor what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”\r\n\r\n“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across the\r\nstudio towards Basil Hallward.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\r\n\r\n“But why not?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their\r\nnames to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown\r\nto love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life\r\nmysterious or marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if\r\none only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I\r\nam going. If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit,\r\nI dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into\r\none’s life. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear Basil. You seem\r\nto forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it\r\nmakes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\r\nnever know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.\r\nWhen we meet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go\r\ndown to the Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the\r\nmost serious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact,\r\nthan I am. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But\r\nwhen she does find me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish\r\nshe would; but she merely laughs at me.”\r\n\r\n“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said Basil\r\nHallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\r\nbelieve that you are really a very good husband, but that you are\r\nthoroughly ashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary\r\nfellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing.\r\nYour cynicism is simply a pose.”\r\n\r\n“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,”\r\ncried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the\r\ngarden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that\r\nstood in the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the\r\npolished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\r\ngoing, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\r\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the ground.\r\n\r\n“You know quite well.”\r\n\r\n“I do not, Harry.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\r\nwon’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\r\n\r\n“I told you the real reason.”\r\n\r\n“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of\r\nyourself in it. Now, that is childish.”\r\n\r\n“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face, “every\r\nportrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not\r\nof the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is\r\nnot he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on\r\nthe coloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit\r\nthis picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of\r\nmy own soul.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came\r\nover his face.\r\n\r\n“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the painter;\r\n“and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will hardly\r\nbelieve it.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from\r\nthe grass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\r\nreplied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk,\r\n“and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it\r\nis quite incredible.”\r\n\r\nThe wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy\r\nlilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the\r\nlanguid air. A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a\r\nblue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze\r\nwings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward’s heart\r\nbeating, and wondered what was coming.\r\n\r\n“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time. “Two\r\nmonths ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we poor\r\nartists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\r\nremind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a\r\nwhite tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain\r\na reputation for being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room\r\nabout ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious\r\nacademicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at\r\nme. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.\r\nWhen our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation\r\nof terror came over me. I knew that I had come face to face with some\r\none whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to\r\ndo so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art\r\nitself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\r\nyourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my\r\nown master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.\r\nThen—but I don’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to\r\ntell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had\r\na strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and\r\nexquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room. It was\r\nnot conscience that made me do so: it was a sort of cowardice. I take\r\nno credit to myself for trying to escape.”\r\n\r\n“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\r\nis the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do either.\r\nHowever, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I used\r\nto be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of course, I\r\nstumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away so soon,\r\nMr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill voice?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\r\npulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\r\n\r\n“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\r\nwith stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and\r\nparrot noses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her\r\nonce before, but she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe\r\nsome picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had\r\nbeen chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the\r\nnineteenth-century standard of immortality. Suddenly I found myself\r\nface to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely\r\nstirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again.\r\nIt was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\r\nPerhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We\r\nwould have spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of\r\nthat. Dorian told me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined\r\nto know each other.”\r\n\r\n“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked his\r\ncompanion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid _précis_ of all her\r\nguests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\r\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my\r\near, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to\r\neverybody in the room, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I\r\nlike to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests\r\nexactly as an auctioneer treats his goods. She either explains them\r\nentirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants\r\nto know.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\r\nlistlessly.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, she tried to found a _salon_, and only succeeded in\r\nopening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she\r\nsay about Mr. Dorian Gray?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I absolutely\r\ninseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid he—doesn’t do\r\nanything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’\r\nNeither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.”\r\n\r\n“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\r\nthe best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\r\n\r\nHallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\r\nHarry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You like every\r\none; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\r\n\r\n“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat back\r\nand looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of\r\nglossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the\r\nsummer sky. “Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference\r\nbetween people. I choose my friends for their good looks, my\r\nacquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good\r\nintellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies. I\r\nhave not got one who is a fool. They are all men of some intellectual\r\npower, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of\r\nme? I think it is rather vain.”\r\n\r\n“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\r\nmerely an acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\r\n\r\n“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother won’t die,\r\nand my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\r\n\r\n“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting my\r\nrelations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand\r\nother people having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize\r\nwith the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices\r\nof the upper orders. The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and\r\nimmorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of\r\nus makes an ass of himself, he is poaching on their preserves. When\r\npoor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite\r\nmagnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten per cent of the\r\nproletariat live correctly.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\r\nmore, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\r\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\r\nBasil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one\r\nputs forward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\r\nnever dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The\r\nonly thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it\r\noneself. Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with\r\nthe sincerity of the man who expresses it. Indeed, the probabilities\r\nare that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual\r\nwill the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his\r\nwants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I don’t propose to\r\ndiscuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I like persons\r\nbetter than principles, and I like persons with no principles better\r\nthan anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.\r\nHow often do you see him?”\r\n\r\n“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every day. He is\r\nabsolutely necessary to me.”\r\n\r\n“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but\r\nyour art.”\r\n\r\n“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I sometimes\r\nthink, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\r\nworld’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art,\r\nand the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.\r\nWhat the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of\r\nAntinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will\r\nsome day be to me. It is not merely that I paint from him, draw from\r\nhim, sketch from him. Of course, I have done all that. But he is much\r\nmore to me than a model or a sitter. I won’t tell you that I am\r\ndissatisfied with what I have done of him, or that his beauty is such\r\nthat art cannot express it. There is nothing that art cannot express,\r\nand I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good\r\nwork, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I wonder\r\nwill you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an entirely\r\nnew manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\r\ndifferently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a\r\nway that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\r\nthought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray\r\nhas been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems to\r\nme little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\r\nvisible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\r\nUnconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school\r\nthat is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the\r\nperfection of the spirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and\r\nbody—how much that is! We in our madness have separated the two, and\r\nhave invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.\r\nHarry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! You remember that\r\nlandscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but\r\nwhich I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have ever\r\ndone. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray\r\nsat beside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the\r\nfirst time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had\r\nalways looked for and always missed.”\r\n\r\n“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\r\n\r\nHallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After\r\nsome time he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me simply\r\na motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\r\nHe is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there.\r\nHe is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the\r\ncurves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain\r\ncolours. That is all.”\r\n\r\n“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\r\n\r\n“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of\r\nall this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never\r\ncared to speak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know\r\nanything about it. But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my\r\nsoul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under\r\ntheir microscope. There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry—too\r\nmuch of myself!”\r\n\r\n“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion\r\nis for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\r\n\r\n“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should create\r\nbeautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\r\nlive in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\r\nautobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I\r\nwill show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall\r\nnever see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”\r\n\r\n“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is only\r\nthe intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very\r\nfond of you?”\r\n\r\nThe painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered\r\nafter a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully.\r\nI find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall\r\nbe sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit\r\nin the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he\r\nis horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me\r\npain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some\r\none who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of\r\ndecoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.”\r\n\r\n“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\r\n“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\r\nof, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That\r\naccounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate\r\nourselves. In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have\r\nsomething that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and\r\nfacts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The thoroughly\r\nwell-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of the\r\nthoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\r\n_bric-à-brac_ shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\r\nits proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day\r\nyou will look at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little\r\nout of drawing, or you won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You\r\nwill bitterly reproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that\r\nhe has behaved very badly to you. The next time he calls, you will be\r\nperfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will\r\nalter you. What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art\r\none might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is\r\nthat it leaves one so unromantic.”\r\n\r\n“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\r\nDorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change\r\ntoo often.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\r\nfaithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who\r\nknow love’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty\r\nsilver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and\r\nsatisfied air, as if he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was\r\na rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy,\r\nand the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like\r\nswallows. How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other\r\npeople’s emotions were!—much more delightful than their ideas, it\r\nseemed to him. One’s own soul, and the passions of one’s friends—those\r\nwere the fascinating things in life. He pictured to himself with silent\r\namusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long\r\nwith Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his aunt’s, he would have been sure\r\nto have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have\r\nbeen about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model\r\nlodging-houses. Each class would have preached the importance of those\r\nvirtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.\r\nThe rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown\r\neloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped\r\nall that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He\r\nturned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\r\n\r\n“Remembered what, Harry?”\r\n\r\n“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\r\n\r\n“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\r\n\r\n“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha’s. She told\r\nme she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her\r\nin the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am bound to state\r\nthat she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no appreciation\r\nof good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was very\r\nearnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\r\ncreature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping\r\nabout on huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\r\n\r\n“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want you to meet him.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t want me to meet him?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming into\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\r\n\r\nThe painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\r\n“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The man\r\nbowed and went up the walk.\r\n\r\nThen he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,” he\r\nsaid. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\r\nright in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to influence\r\nhim. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\r\nmarvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who\r\ngives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist\r\ndepends on him. Mind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and\r\nthe words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will.\r\n\r\n“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward\r\nby the arm, he almost led him into the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with\r\nhis back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s\r\n“Forest Scenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I want to\r\nlearn them. They are perfectly charming.”\r\n\r\n“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait of\r\nmyself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\r\nwilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint\r\nblush coloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your\r\npardon, Basil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\r\n\r\n“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I\r\nhave just been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you\r\nhave spoiled everything.”\r\n\r\n“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said Lord\r\nHenry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\r\nspoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am\r\nafraid, one of her victims also.”\r\n\r\n“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered Dorian with a\r\nfunny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel\r\nwith her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\r\nhave played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know what\r\nshe will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\r\nAnd I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\r\naudience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to\r\nthe piano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\r\n\r\n“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered Dorian,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\nLord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome,\r\nwith his finely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp\r\ngold hair. There was something in his face that made one trust him at\r\nonce. All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth’s\r\npassionate purity. One felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the\r\nworld. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\r\n\r\n“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too\r\ncharming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened\r\nhis cigarette-case.\r\n\r\nThe painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes\r\nready. He was looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last\r\nremark, he glanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said,\r\n“Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day. Would you think it\r\nawfully rude of me if I asked you to go away?”\r\n\r\nLord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr. Gray?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his sulky\r\nmoods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to tell\r\nme why I should not go in for philanthropy.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so tedious a\r\nsubject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly\r\nshall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You don’t\r\nreally mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your\r\nsitters to have some one to chat to.”\r\n\r\nHallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\r\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil,\r\nbut I am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the\r\nOrleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon\r\nStreet. I am nearly always at home at five o’clock. Write to me when\r\nyou are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.”\r\n\r\n“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go,\r\ntoo. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\r\nhorribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask\r\nhim to stay. I insist upon it.”\r\n\r\n“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\r\ngazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I\r\nam working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious\r\nfor my unfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\r\n\r\n“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\r\n\r\nThe painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty about\r\nthat. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform,\r\nand don’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry\r\nsays. He has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single\r\nexception of myself.”\r\n\r\nDorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek\r\nmartyr, and made a little _moue_ of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom\r\nhe had rather taken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a\r\ndelightful contrast. And he had such a beautiful voice. After a few\r\nmoments he said to him, “Have you really a very bad influence, Lord\r\nHenry? As bad as Basil says?”\r\n\r\n“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\r\nimmoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does\r\nnot think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\r\nvirtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as\r\nsins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an\r\nactor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is\r\nself-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each\r\nof us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have\r\nforgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s\r\nself. Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe\r\nthe beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone\r\nout of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society,\r\nwhich is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of\r\nreligion—these are the two things that govern us. And yet—”\r\n\r\n“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\r\nboy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\r\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\r\n\r\n“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with\r\nthat graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of\r\nhim, and that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man\r\nwere to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to\r\nevery feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream—I\r\nbelieve that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we\r\nwould forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the\r\nHellenic ideal—to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it\r\nmay be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The\r\nmutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial\r\nthat mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse\r\nthat we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\r\nsins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of\r\npurification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure,\r\nor the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is\r\nto yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for\r\nthe things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its\r\nmonstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that\r\nthe great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the\r\nbrain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place\r\nalso. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\r\nrose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid,\r\nthoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping\r\ndreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—”\r\n\r\n“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I don’t know what\r\nto say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don’t speak.\r\nLet me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think.”\r\n\r\nFor nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and\r\neyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh\r\ninfluences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come\r\nreally from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to\r\nhim—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in\r\nthem—had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before,\r\nbut that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.\r\n\r\nMusic had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But\r\nmusic was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another\r\nchaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they\r\nwere! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them.\r\nAnd yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able\r\nto give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their\r\nown as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything\r\nso real as words?\r\n\r\nYes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood.\r\nHe understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It\r\nseemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known\r\nit?\r\n\r\nWith his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\r\npsychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested.\r\nHe was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced,\r\nand, remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen, a book\r\nwhich had revealed to him much that he had not known before, he\r\nwondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.\r\nHe had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How\r\nfascinating the lad was!\r\n\r\nHallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had\r\nthe true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes\r\nonly from strength. He was unconscious of the silence.\r\n\r\n“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly. “I must go\r\nout and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\r\n\r\n“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think of\r\nanything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And\r\nI have caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright\r\nlook in the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but\r\nhe has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose\r\nhe has been paying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he\r\nsays.”\r\n\r\n“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\r\nreason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”\r\n\r\n“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with his\r\ndreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is\r\nhorribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\r\nsomething with strawberries in it.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will\r\ntell him what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I\r\nwill join you later on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been\r\nin better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my\r\nmasterpiece. It is my masterpiece as it stands.”\r\n\r\nLord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his\r\nface in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their\r\nperfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him and put his hand\r\nupon his shoulder. “You are quite right to do that,” he murmured.\r\n“Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the\r\nsenses but the soul.”\r\n\r\nThe lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had\r\ntossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There\r\nwas a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are\r\nsuddenly awakened. His finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some\r\nhidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great secrets of\r\nlife—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means\r\nof the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think\r\nyou know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\r\n\r\nDorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking\r\nthe tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic,\r\nolive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was\r\nsomething in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His\r\ncool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved,\r\nas he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.\r\nBut he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been\r\nleft for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil\r\nHallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\r\nhim. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to\r\nhave disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be\r\nafraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker has brought\r\nout the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be\r\nquite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must\r\nnot allow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”\r\n\r\n“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down on\r\nthe seat at the end of the garden.\r\n\r\n“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\r\nworth having.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”\r\n\r\n“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and\r\nugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\r\nbranded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will\r\nfeel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it\r\nalways be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray.\r\nDon’t frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius—is higher,\r\nindeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great\r\nfacts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in\r\ndark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be\r\nquestioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of\r\nthose who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t\r\nsmile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That\r\nmay be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\r\nbeauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not\r\njudge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not\r\nthe invisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But\r\nwhat the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in\r\nwhich to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your\r\nbeauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there\r\nare no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those\r\nmean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than\r\ndefeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something\r\ndreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your\r\nroses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You\r\nwill suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it.\r\nDon’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying\r\nto improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the\r\nignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the\r\nfalse ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!\r\nLet nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.\r\nBe afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism—that is what our century wants.\r\nYou might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing\r\nyou could not do. The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment\r\nI met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are,\r\nof what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me\r\nthat I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how\r\ntragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time\r\nthat your youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers\r\nwither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next\r\nJune as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the\r\nclematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold\r\nits purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy\r\nthat beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses\r\nrot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the\r\npassions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite\r\ntemptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth!\r\nThere is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”\r\n\r\nDorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell\r\nfrom his hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for\r\na moment. Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe\r\nof the tiny blossoms. He watched it with that strange interest in\r\ntrivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make\r\nus afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we\r\ncannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays\r\nsudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a time the\r\nbee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\r\nconvolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and\r\nfro.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made\r\nstaccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and\r\nyou can bring your drinks.”\r\n\r\nThey rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\r\nbutterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of\r\nthe garden a thrush began to sing.\r\n\r\n“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”\r\n\r\n“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\r\nWomen are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to\r\nmake it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only\r\ndifference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice\r\nlasts a little longer.”\r\n\r\nAs they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s\r\narm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\r\nflushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and\r\nresumed his pose.\r\n\r\nLord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him.\r\nThe sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that\r\nbroke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back\r\nto look at his work from a distance. In the slanting beams that\r\nstreamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden. The\r\nheavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything.\r\n\r\nAfter about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for\r\na long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture,\r\nbiting the end of one of his huge b"

M., on 1st May, arriving at\r\nVienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an\r\nhour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I\r\ngot of it from the train and the little I could walk through the\r\nstreets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived\r\nlate and would start as near the correct time as possible. The\r\nimpression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the\r\nEast; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is\r\nhere of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nWe left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.\r\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or\r\nrather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was\r\nvery good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the\r\nwaiter, and he said it was called \"paprika hendl,\" and that, as it was a\r\nnational dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the\r\nCarpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I\r\ndon't know how I should be able to get on without it.\r\n\r\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the\r\nBritish Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library\r\nregarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the\r\ncountry could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a\r\nnobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the\r\nextreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,\r\nTransylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian\r\nmountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was\r\nnot able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the\r\nCastle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare\r\nwith our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post\r\ntown named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter\r\nhere some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my\r\ntravels with Mina.\r\n\r\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:\r\nSaxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the\r\ndescendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the\r\nEast and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended\r\nfrom Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered\r\nthe country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I\r\nread that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the\r\nhorseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of\r\nimaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I\r\nmust ask the Count all about them.)\r\n\r\nI did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had\r\nall sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my\r\nwindow, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been\r\nthe paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was\r\nstill thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous\r\nknocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.\r\nI had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour\r\nwhich they said was \"mamaliga,\" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a\r\nvery excellent dish, which they call \"impletata.\" (_Mem._, get recipe\r\nfor this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little\r\nbefore eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to\r\nthe station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour\r\nbefore we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the\r\nmore unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?\r\n\r\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of\r\nbeauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the\r\ntop of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by\r\nrivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side\r\nof them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and\r\nrunning strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every\r\nstation there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts\r\nof attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I\r\nsaw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats\r\nand home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women\r\nlooked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy\r\nabout the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,\r\nand most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something\r\nfluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there\r\nwere petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the\r\nSlovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy\r\nhats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous\r\nheavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass\r\nnails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and\r\nhad long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very\r\npicturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be\r\nset down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,\r\nhowever, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural\r\nself-assertion.\r\n\r\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a\r\nvery interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the\r\nBorgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy\r\nexistence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series\r\nof great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate\r\noccasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent\r\na siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war\r\nproper being assisted by famine and disease.\r\n\r\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I\r\nfound, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of\r\ncourse I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was\r\nevidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a\r\ncheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white\r\nundergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff\r\nfitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and\r\nsaid, \"The Herr Englishman?\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"Jonathan Harker.\" She\r\nsmiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,\r\nwho had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with\r\na letter:--\r\n\r\n     \"My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting\r\n     you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will\r\n     start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo\r\n     Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust\r\n     that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you\r\n     will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend,\r\n\r\n\"DRACULA.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,\r\ndirecting him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on\r\nmaking inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and\r\npretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be\r\ntrue, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he\r\nanswered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old\r\nlady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of\r\nway. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that\r\nwas all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could\r\ntell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,\r\nand, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak\r\nfurther. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask\r\nany one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means\r\ncomforting.\r\n\r\nJust before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a\r\nvery hysterical way:\r\n\r\n\"Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?\" She was in such an excited\r\nstate that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and\r\nmixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I\r\nwas just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her\r\nthat I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,\r\nshe asked again:\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what day it is?\" I answered that it was the fourth of May.\r\nShe shook her head as she said again:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?\" On\r\nmy saying that I did not understand, she went on:\r\n\r\n\"It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when\r\nthe clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have\r\nfull sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?\"\r\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but\r\nwithout effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not\r\nto go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very\r\nridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business\r\nto be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore\r\ntried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked\r\nher, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and\r\ndried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I\r\ndid not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been\r\ntaught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it\r\nseemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a\r\nstate of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the\r\nrosary round my neck, and said, \"For your mother's sake,\" and went out\r\nof the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting\r\nfor the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still\r\nround my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly\r\ntraditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I\r\nam not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should\r\never reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the\r\ncoach!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is\r\nhigh over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or\r\nhills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are\r\nmixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,\r\nnaturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put\r\ndown, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I\r\nleft Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they\r\ncalled \"robber steak\"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red\r\npepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple\r\nstyle of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which\r\nproduces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not\r\ndisagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhen I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him\r\ntalking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every\r\nnow and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting\r\non the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning\r\n\"word-bearer\"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them\r\npityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for\r\nthere were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot\r\ndictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not\r\ncheering to me, for amongst them were \"Ordog\"--Satan, \"pokol\"--hell,\r\n\"stregoica\"--witch, \"vrolok\" and \"vlkoslak\"--both of which mean the same\r\nthing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is\r\neither were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these\r\nsuperstitions)\r\n\r\nWhen we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time\r\nswelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and\r\npointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a\r\nfellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at\r\nfirst, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a\r\ncharm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,\r\njust starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one\r\nseemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I\r\ncould not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I\r\nhad of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing\r\nthemselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of\r\nrich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the\r\ncentre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered\r\nthe whole front of the box-seat--\"gotza\" they call them--cracked his big\r\nwhip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on\r\nour journey.\r\n\r\nI soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the\r\nscene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather\r\nlanguages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have\r\nbeen able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping\r\nland full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned\r\nwith clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the\r\nroad. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,\r\nplum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under\r\nthe trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these\r\ngreen hills of what they call here the \"Mittel Land\" ran the road,\r\nlosing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the\r\nstraggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the\r\nhillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we\r\nseemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then\r\nwhat the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no\r\ntime in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime\r\nexcellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter\r\nsnows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in\r\nthe Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept\r\nin too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the\r\nTurk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,\r\nand so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.\r\n\r\nBeyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes\r\nof forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right\r\nand left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon\r\nthem and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,\r\ndeep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where\r\ngrass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and\r\npointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where\r\nthe snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the\r\nmountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again\r\nthe white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as\r\nwe swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered\r\npeak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to\r\nbe right before us:--\r\n\r\n\"Look! Isten szek!\"--\"God's seat!\"--and he crossed himself reverently.\r\n\r\nAs we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind\r\nus, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was\r\nemphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the\r\nsunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there\r\nwe passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed\r\nthat goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,\r\nand as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there\r\nwas a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even\r\nturn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of\r\ndevotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were\r\nmany things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here\r\nand there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems\r\nshining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and\r\nagain we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its\r\nlong, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the\r\nroad. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming\r\npeasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their\r\ncoloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long\r\nstaves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,\r\nand the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the\r\ngloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which\r\nran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the\r\nPass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of\r\nlate-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods\r\nthat seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of\r\ngreyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a\r\npeculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and\r\ngrim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset\r\nthrew into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the\r\nCarpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the\r\nhills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could\r\nonly go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,\r\nbut the driver would not hear of it. \"No, no,\" he said; \"you must not\r\nwalk here; the dogs are too fierce\"; and then he added, with what he\r\nevidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the\r\napproving smile of the rest--\"and you may have enough of such matters\r\nbefore you go to sleep.\" The only stop he would make was a moment's\r\npause to light his lamps.\r\n\r\nWhen it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the\r\npassengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as\r\nthough urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully\r\nwith his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on\r\nto further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of\r\npatch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the\r\nhills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach\r\nrocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a\r\nstormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared\r\nto fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each\r\nside and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One\r\nby one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed\r\nupon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were\r\ncertainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good\r\nfaith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of\r\nfear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at\r\nBistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.\r\nThen, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the\r\npassengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the\r\ndarkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either\r\nhappening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would\r\ngive me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for\r\nsome little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on\r\nthe eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the\r\nair the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the\r\nmountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got\r\ninto the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance\r\nwhich was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the\r\nglare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light\r\nwas the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our\r\nhard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy\r\nroad lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.\r\nThe passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock\r\nmy own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when\r\nthe driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I\r\ncould hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I\r\nthought it was \"An hour less than the time.\" Then turning to me, he said\r\nin German worse than my own:--\r\n\r\n\"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will\r\nnow come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better\r\nthe next day.\" Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and\r\nsnort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,\r\namongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing\r\nof themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook\r\nus, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our\r\nlamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and\r\nsplendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown\r\nbeard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I\r\ncould only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red\r\nin the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--\r\n\r\n\"You are early to-night, my friend.\" The man stammered in reply:--\r\n\r\n\"The English Herr was in a hurry,\" to which the stranger replied:--\r\n\r\n\"That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot\r\ndeceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift.\" As he\r\nspoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with\r\nvery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my\r\ncompanions whispered to another the line from Burger's \"Lenore\":--\r\n\r\n    \"Denn die Todten reiten schnell\"--\r\n    (\"For the dead travel fast.\")\r\n\r\nThe strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a\r\ngleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time\r\nputting out his two fingers and crossing himself. \"Give me the Herr's\r\nluggage,\" said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were\r\nhanded out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the\r\ncoach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a\r\nhand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been\r\nprodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we\r\nswept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam\r\nfrom the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected\r\nagainst it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then\r\nthe driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept\r\non their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a\r\nstrange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown\r\nover my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in\r\nexcellent German:--\r\n\r\n\"The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all\r\ncare of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the\r\ncountry) underneath the seat, if you should require it.\" I did not take\r\nany, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a\r\nlittle strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been\r\nany alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that\r\nunknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,\r\nthen we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It\r\nseemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground\r\nagain; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was\r\nso. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but\r\nI really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any\r\nprotest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to\r\ndelay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was\r\npassing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was\r\nwithin a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I\r\nsuppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my\r\nrecent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.\r\n\r\nThen a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a\r\nlong, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by\r\nanother dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which\r\nnow sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed\r\nto come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp\r\nit through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to\r\nstrain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they\r\nquieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from\r\nsudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each\r\nside of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which\r\naffected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to\r\njump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged\r\nmadly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them\r\nfrom bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to\r\nthe sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able\r\nto descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and\r\nwhispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers\r\ndoing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became\r\nquite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again\r\ntook his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This\r\ntime, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a\r\nnarrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.\r\n\r\nSoon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the\r\nroadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning\r\nrocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we\r\ncould hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the\r\nrocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.\r\nIt grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,\r\nso that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The\r\nkeen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew\r\nfainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer\r\nand nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I\r\ngrew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,\r\nhowever, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to\r\nleft and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The\r\ndriver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,\r\njumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know\r\nwhat to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while\r\nI wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took\r\nhis seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep\r\nand kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated\r\nendlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.\r\nOnce the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness\r\naround us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where\r\nthe blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem\r\nto illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,\r\nformed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical\r\neffect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,\r\nfor I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but\r\nas the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me\r\nstraining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue\r\nflames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the\r\nwolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he\r\nhad yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse\r\nthan ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause\r\nfor it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just\r\nthen the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the\r\njagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw\r\naround us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,\r\nwith long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more\r\nterrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.\r\nFor myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man\r\nfeels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand\r\ntheir true import.\r\n\r\nAll at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had\r\nsome peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and\r\nlooked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;\r\nbut the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they\r\nhad perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for\r\nit seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the\r\nring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the\r\ncalèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as\r\nto give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know\r\nnot, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and\r\nlooking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his\r\nlong arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves\r\nfell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across\r\nthe face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.\r\n\r\nWhen I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the\r\nwolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a\r\ndreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time\r\nseemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete\r\ndarkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on\r\nascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main\r\nalways ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the\r\ndriver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a\r\nvast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,\r\nand whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nJONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_\r\n\r\n\r\n_5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully\r\nawake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In\r\nthe gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark\r\nways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than\r\nit really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand\r\nto assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious\r\nstrength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have\r\ncrushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed\r\nthem on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and\r\nstudded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of\r\nmassive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was\r\nmassively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and\r\nweather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the\r\nreins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one\r\nof the dark openings.\r\n\r\nI stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell\r\nor knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark\r\nwindow openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The\r\ntime I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon\r\nme. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?\r\nWhat sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a\r\ncustomary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to\r\nexplain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's\r\nclerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving\r\nLondon I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a\r\nfull-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if\r\nI were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I\r\nexpected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with\r\nthe dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt\r\nin the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the\r\npinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake\r\nand among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to\r\nwait the coming of the morning.\r\n\r\nJust as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching\r\nbehind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming\r\nlight. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of\r\nmassive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise\r\nof long disuse, and the great door swung back.\r\n\r\nWithin, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white\r\nmoustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck\r\nof colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver\r\nlamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,\r\nthrowing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the\r\nopen door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly\r\ngesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!\" He made no\r\nmotion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his\r\ngesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that\r\nI had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and\r\nholding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,\r\nan effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as\r\nice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the\r\nhappiness you bring!\" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to\r\nthat which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that\r\nfor a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was\r\nspeaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--\r\n\r\n\"Count Dracula?\" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--\r\n\r\n\"I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;\r\nthe night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest.\" As he was\r\nspeaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,\r\ntook my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I\r\nprotested but he insisted:--\r\n\r\n\"Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not\r\navailable. Let me see to your comfort myself.\" He insisted on carrying\r\nmy traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and\r\nalong another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang\r\nheavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced\r\nto see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,\r\nand on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,\r\nflamed and flared.\r\n\r\nThe Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing\r\nthe room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit\r\nby a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing\r\nthrough this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a\r\nwelcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with\r\nanother log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were\r\nfresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself\r\nleft my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the\r\ndoor:--\r\n\r\n\"You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your\r\ntoilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come\r\ninto the other room, where you will find your supper prepared.\"\r\n\r\nThe light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have\r\ndissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,\r\nI discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty\r\ntoilet, I went into the other room.\r\n\r\nI found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the\r\ngreat fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of\r\nhis hand to the table, and said:--\r\n\r\n\"I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse\r\nme that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup.\"\r\n\r\nI handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.\r\nHe opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed\r\nit to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant\r\nsufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to\r\ncome; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in\r\nwhom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy\r\nand talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is\r\ndiscreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall\r\nbe ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take\r\nyour instructions in all matters.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I\r\nfell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese\r\nand a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was\r\nmy supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many\r\nquestions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn\r\nup a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,\r\nat the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an\r\nopportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked\r\nphysiognomy.\r\n\r\nHis face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the\r\nthin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and\r\nhair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His\r\neyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy\r\nhair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I\r\ncould see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather\r\ncruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over\r\nthe lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a\r\nman of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops\r\nextremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm\r\nthough thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.\r\n\r\nHitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees\r\nin the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing\r\nthem now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather\r\ncoarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in\r\nthe centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp\r\npoint. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not\r\nrepress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a\r\nhorrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could\r\nnot conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a\r\ngrim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his\r\nprotuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the\r\nfireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the\r\nwindow I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a\r\nstrange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from\r\ndown below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes\r\ngleamed, and he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!\"\r\nSeeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he\r\nadded:--\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the\r\nhunter.\" Then he rose and said:--\r\n\r\n\"But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you\r\nshall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;\r\nso sleep well and dream well!\" With a courteous bow, he opened for me\r\nhimself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....\r\n\r\nI am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,\r\nwhich I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the\r\nsake of those dear to me!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the\r\nlast twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my\r\nown accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had\r\nsupped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the\r\npot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which\r\nwas written:--\r\n\r\n\"I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D.\" I set to and\r\nenjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I\r\nmight let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.\r\nThere are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the\r\nextraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service\r\nis of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.\r\nThe curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of\r\nmy bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have\r\nbeen of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,\r\nthough in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,\r\nbut there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of\r\nthe rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my\r\ntable, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I\r\ncould either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant\r\nanywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.\r\nSome time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it\r\nbreakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had\r\nit--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about\r\nthe castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was\r\nabsolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing\r\nmaterials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of\r\nlibrary. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.\r\n\r\nIn the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English\r\nbooks, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and\r\nnewspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines\r\nand newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books\r\nwere of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political\r\neconomy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life\r\nand customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the\r\nLondon Directory, the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the\r\nArmy and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the\r\nLaw List.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count\r\nentered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good\r\nnight's rest. Then he went on:--\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that\r\nwill interest you. These companions\"--and he laid his hand on some of\r\nthe books--\"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever\r\nsince I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours\r\nof pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to\r\nknow her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of\r\nyour mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of\r\nhumanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes\r\nit what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.\r\nTo you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Count,\" I said, \"you know and speak English thoroughly!\" He bowed\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I\r\nfear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know\r\nthe grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" I said, \"you speak excellently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" he answered. \"Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your\r\nLondon, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not\r\nenough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,\r\nand I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men\r\nknow him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am\r\nlike the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his\r\nspeaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long\r\nmaster that I would be master still--or at least that none other should\r\nbe master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter\r\nHawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You\r\nshall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may\r\nlearn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make\r\nerror, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be\r\naway so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many\r\nimportant affairs in hand.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I said all I could about being willing, and asked if I might\r\ncome into that room when I chose. He answered: \"Yes, certainly,\" and\r\nadded:--\r\n\r\n\"You may go anywhere you wish in the castle, except where the doors are\r\nlocked, where of course you will not wish to go. There is reason that\r\nall things are as they are, and did you see with my eyes and kno"

		    "text": "A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nThe Period\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of\r\nwisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it\r\nwas the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the\r\nseason of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of\r\ndespair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were\r\nall going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in\r\nshort, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its\r\nnoisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\r\nevil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\r\n\r\nThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\r\nthrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\r\na fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\r\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\r\nthat things in general were settled for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\r\nSpiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\r\nas at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\r\nblessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\r\nheralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\r\nmade for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\r\nghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\r\nmessages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\r\ndeficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\r\nearthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\r\nfrom a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\r\nto relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\r\ncommunications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\r\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\r\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\r\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\r\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\r\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\r\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\r\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\r\nyards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\r\nNorway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\r\nalready marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\r\nboards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\r\nit, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\r\nof some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\r\nsheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\r\nrustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\r\nthe Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\r\nthe Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\r\nunceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\r\nwith muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\r\nthat they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\r\n\r\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\r\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\r\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\r\nfamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\r\ntheir furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman\r\nin the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\r\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\r\n“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\r\nmail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\r\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\r\nfailure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\r\nthat magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\r\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\r\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London\r\ngaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law\r\nfired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;\r\nthieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at\r\nCourt drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search\r\nfor contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the\r\nmusketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences\r\nmuch out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy\r\nand ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing\r\nup long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on\r\nSaturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the\r\nhand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of\r\nWestminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,\r\nand to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of\r\nsixpence.\r\n\r\nAll these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close\r\nupon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\r\nEnvironed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,\r\nthose two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the\r\nfair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\r\nwith a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred\r\nand seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small\r\ncreatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the\r\nroads that lay before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nThe Mail\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\r\nbefore the first of the persons with whom this history has business.\r\nThe Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\r\nShooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,\r\nas the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\r\nfor walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\r\nand the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\r\nhorses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the\r\ncoach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\r\nto Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\r\ncombination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\r\notherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\r\nare endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to\r\ntheir duty.\r\n\r\nWith drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through\r\nthe thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were\r\nfalling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested\r\nthem and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-ho-then!” the\r\nnear leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\r\nunusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\r\nhill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\r\nnervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\r\n\r\nThere was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\r\nforlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\r\nnone. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\r\nair in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\r\nwaves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\r\neverything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\r\nand a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\r\ninto it, as if they had made it all.\r\n\r\nTwo other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\r\nside of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\r\nears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\r\nanything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\r\nhidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\r\nthe eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\r\nwere very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\r\nthe road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\r\nwhen every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\r\n“the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\r\nnon-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard\r\nof the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\r\nthousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill, as\r\nhe stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\r\nand keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\r\nloaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\r\ndeposited on a substratum of cutlass.\r\n\r\nThe Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\r\nthe passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\r\nall suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\r\nthe horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\r\ntaken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re at the\r\ntop and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\r\nit!--Joe!”\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” the guard replied.\r\n\r\n“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”\r\n\r\n“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”\r\n\r\n“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of Shooter’s\r\nyet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”\r\n\r\nThe emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\r\nmade a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\r\nsuit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\r\npassengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\r\nstopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\r\nhad had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\r\ninto the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\r\ngetting shot instantly as a highwayman.\r\n\r\nThe last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\r\nstopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\r\nthe descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.\r\n\r\n“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n“What do you say, Tom?”\r\n\r\nThey both listened.\r\n\r\n“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”\r\n\r\n“_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his hold\r\nof the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the king’s\r\nname, all of you!”\r\n\r\nWith this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on\r\nthe offensive.\r\n\r\nThe passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;\r\nthe two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He\r\nremained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained\r\nin the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,\r\nand from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked\r\nback and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up\r\nhis ears and looked back, without contradicting.\r\n\r\nThe stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring\r\nof the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet\r\nindeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to\r\nthe coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the\r\npassengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the\r\nquiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding\r\nthe breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.\r\n\r\nThe sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.\r\n\r\n“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there! Stand!\r\nI shall fire!”\r\n\r\nThe pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,\r\na man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”\r\n\r\n“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”\r\n\r\n“_Is_ that the Dover mail?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you want to know?”\r\n\r\n“I want a passenger, if it is.”\r\n\r\n“What passenger?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”\r\n\r\nOur booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,\r\nthe coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.\r\n\r\n“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,\r\n“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in\r\nyour lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering\r\nspeech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”\r\n\r\n(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to\r\nhimself. “He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”\r\n\r\n“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the\r\nroad--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two\r\npassengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and\r\npulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing wrong.”\r\n\r\n“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ‘Nation sure of that,” said the\r\nguard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”\r\n\r\n“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.\r\n\r\n“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters to that\r\nsaddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m a devil\r\nat a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So\r\nnow let’s look at you.”\r\n\r\nThe figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,\r\nand came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider\r\nstooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger\r\na small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse and\r\nrider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of\r\nthe man.\r\n\r\n“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.\r\n\r\nThe watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised\r\nblunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,\r\nanswered curtly, “Sir.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You must\r\nknow Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown\r\nto drink. I may read this?”\r\n\r\n“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”\r\n\r\nHe opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and\r\nread--first to himself and then aloud: “‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’\r\nIt’s not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED\r\nTO LIFE.”\r\n\r\nJerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”\r\n said he, at his hoarsest.\r\n\r\n“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as\r\nwell as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”\r\n\r\nWith those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at\r\nall assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted\r\ntheir watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general\r\npretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape\r\nthe hazard of originating any other kind of action.\r\n\r\nThe coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round\r\nit as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss\r\nin his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and\r\nhaving looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,\r\nlooked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a\r\nfew smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was\r\nfurnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown\r\nand stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut\r\nhimself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,\r\nand get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in\r\nfive minutes.\r\n\r\n“Tom!” softly over the coach roof.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Joe.”\r\n\r\n“Did you hear the message?”\r\n\r\n“I did, Joe.”\r\n\r\n“What did you make of it, Tom?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all, Joe.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same of it\r\nmyself.”\r\n\r\nJerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not\r\nonly to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and\r\nshake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of\r\nholding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his\r\nheavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within\r\nhearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n“After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your\r\nfore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger,\r\nglancing at his mare. “‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange\r\nmessage. Much of that wouldn’t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You’d\r\nbe in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,\r\nJerry!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nThe Night Shadows\r\n\r\n\r\nA wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is\r\nconstituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A\r\nsolemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every\r\none of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every\r\nroom in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating\r\nheart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of\r\nits imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the\r\nawfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I\r\nturn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time\r\nto read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable\r\nwater, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses\r\nof buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the\r\nbook should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read\r\nbut a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an\r\neternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood\r\nin ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,\r\nmy love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable\r\nconsolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that\r\nindividuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s end. In\r\nany of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there\r\na sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their\r\ninnermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?\r\n\r\nAs to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the\r\nmessenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the\r\nfirst Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the\r\nthree passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail\r\ncoach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had\r\nbeen in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the\r\nbreadth of a county between him and the next.\r\n\r\nThe messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at\r\nale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his\r\nown counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that\r\nassorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with\r\nno depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they\r\nwere afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too\r\nfar apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like\r\na three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and\r\nthroat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped\r\nfor drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he\r\npoured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he\r\nmuffled again.\r\n\r\n“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.\r\n“It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn’t\r\nsuit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don’t think he’d\r\nbeen a drinking!”\r\n\r\nHis message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several\r\ntimes, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,\r\nwhich was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all\r\nover it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was\r\nso like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked\r\nwall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might\r\nhave declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.\r\n\r\nWhile he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night\r\nwatchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar, who\r\nwas to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the\r\nnight took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such\r\nshapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.\r\nThey seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.\r\n\r\nWhat time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon\r\nits tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,\r\nlikewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms\r\ntheir dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.\r\n\r\nTellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank\r\npassenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what\r\nlay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,\r\nand driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special\r\njolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little\r\ncoach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the\r\nbulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great\r\nstroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,\r\nand more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with\r\nall its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then\r\nthe strong-rooms underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable\r\nstores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a\r\nlittle that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among\r\nthem with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them\r\nsafe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.\r\n\r\nBut, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach\r\n(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was\r\nalways with him, there was another current of impression that never\r\nceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one\r\nout of a grave.\r\n\r\nNow, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him\r\nwas the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did\r\nnot indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by\r\nyears, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,\r\nand in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,\r\ndefiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;\r\nso did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands\r\nand figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was\r\nprematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this\r\nspectre:\r\n\r\n“Buried how long?”\r\n\r\nThe answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”\r\n\r\n“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”\r\n\r\n“Long ago.”\r\n\r\n“You know that you are recalled to life?”\r\n\r\n“They tell me so.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you care to live?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”\r\n\r\nThe answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes\r\nthe broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon.”\r\n Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,\r\n“Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it\r\nwas, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”\r\n\r\nAfter such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,\r\nand dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his\r\nhands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth\r\nhanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The\r\npassenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the\r\nreality of mist and rain on his cheek.\r\n\r\nYet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving\r\npatch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating\r\nby jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train\r\nof the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the\r\nreal business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express\r\nsent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out\r\nof the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost\r\nit again.\r\n\r\n“Buried how long?”\r\n\r\n“Almost eighteen years.”\r\n\r\n“I hope you care to live?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t say.”\r\n\r\nDig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two\r\npassengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm\r\nsecurely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two\r\nslumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again\r\nslid away into the bank and the grave.\r\n\r\n“Buried how long?”\r\n\r\n“Almost eighteen years.”\r\n\r\n“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”\r\n\r\n“Long ago.”\r\n\r\nThe words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in\r\nhis hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary\r\npassenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the\r\nshadows of the night were gone.\r\n\r\nHe lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a\r\nridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left\r\nlast night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,\r\nin which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained\r\nupon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,\r\nand the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.\r\n\r\n“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious\r\nCreator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nThe Preparation\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,\r\nthe head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his\r\ncustom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey\r\nfrom London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous\r\ntraveller upon.\r\n\r\nBy that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be\r\ncongratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective\r\nroadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp\r\nand dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather\r\nlike a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out\r\nof it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and\r\nmuddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.\r\n\r\n“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The\r\ntide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”\r\n\r\n“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.\r\nShow Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off\r\ngentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)\r\nFetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”\r\n\r\nThe Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the\r\nmail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from\r\nhead to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the\r\nRoyal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,\r\nall kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another\r\ndrawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all\r\nloitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord\r\nand the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a\r\nbrown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large\r\nsquare cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to\r\nhis breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman\r\nin brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,\r\nwith its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,\r\nthat he might have been sitting for his portrait.\r\n\r\nVery orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a\r\nloud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,\r\nas though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and\r\nevanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain\r\nof it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a\r\nfine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He\r\nwore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his\r\nhead: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which\r\nlooked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.\r\nHis linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,\r\nwas as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring\r\nbeach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A\r\nface habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the\r\nquaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost\r\ntheir owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and\r\nreserved expression of Tellson’s Bank. He had a healthy colour in his\r\ncheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.\r\nBut, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson’s Bank were\r\nprincipally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps\r\nsecond-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.\r\n\r\nCompleting his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,\r\nMr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,\r\nand he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:\r\n\r\n“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any\r\ntime to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a\r\ngentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in\r\ntheir travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A\r\nvast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s House.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last\r\nfrom France.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s\r\ntime here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I believe so.”\r\n\r\n“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and\r\nCompany was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen\r\nyears ago?”\r\n\r\n“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from\r\nthe truth.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir!”\r\n\r\nRounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the\r\ntable, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,\r\ndropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while\r\nhe ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the\r\nimmemorial usage of waiters in all ages.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on\r\nthe beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away\r\nfrom the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine\r\nostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling\r\nwildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was\r\ndestruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and\r\nbrought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong\r\na piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be\r\ndipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little\r\nfishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by\r\nnight, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide\r\nmade, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,\r\nsometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable\r\nthat nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.\r\n\r\nAs the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been\r\nat intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became\r\nagain charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to cloud\r\ntoo. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting\r\nhis dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,\r\ndigging, digging, in the live red coals.\r\n\r\nA bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no\r\nharm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.\r\nMr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last\r\nglassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is\r\never to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has\r\ngot to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow\r\nstreet, and rumbled into the inn-yard.\r\n\r\nHe set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette\r\nhad arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from\r\nTellson’s.\r\n\r\n“So soon?”\r\n\r\nMiss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none\r\nthen, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s\r\nimmediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty his\r\nglass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen\r\nwig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment.\r\nIt was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black\r\nhorsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and\r\noiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room\r\nwere gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep\r\ngraves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected\r\nfrom them until they were dug out.\r\n\r\nThe obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his\r\nway over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for\r\nthe moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall\r\ncandles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and\r\nthe fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,\r\nand still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As\r\nhis eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden\r\nhair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and\r\na forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth\r\nit was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was\r\nnot quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright\r\nfixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his\r\neyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,\r\nof a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very\r\nChannel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran\r\nhigh. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of\r\nthe gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital\r\nprocession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were\r\noffering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the\r\nfeminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.\r\n\r\n“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a\r\nlittle foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.\r\n\r\n“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier\r\ndate, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.\r\n\r\n“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that\r\nsome intelligence--or discovery--”\r\n\r\n“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”\r\n\r\n“--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so\r\nlong dead--”\r\n\r\nMr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the\r\nhospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for\r\nanybody in their absurd baskets!\r\n\r\n“--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate\r\nwith a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for\r\nthe purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Myself.”\r\n\r\n“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”\r\n\r\nShe curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a\r\npretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he\r\nwas than she. He made her another bow.\r\n\r\n“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by\r\nthose who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to\r\nFrance, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with\r\nme, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,\r\nduring the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection. The\r\ngentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to\r\nbeg the favour of his waiting for me here.”\r\n\r\n“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I shall\r\nbe more happy to execute it.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me\r\nby the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the\r\nbusiness, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising\r\nnature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a\r\nstrong and eager interest to know what they are.”\r\n\r\n“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes--I--”\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the\r\nears, “It is very difficult to begin.”\r\n\r\nHe did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young\r\nforehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty\r\nand characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,\r\nas if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\n“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with\r\nan argumentative smile.\r\n\r\nBetween the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of\r\nwhich was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression\r\ndeepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which\r\nshe had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the\r\nmoment she raised her eyes again, went on:\r\n\r\n“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you\r\nas a young English lady, Miss Manette?”\r\n\r\n“If you please, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to\r\nacquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than\r\nif I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with\r\nyour leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”\r\n\r\n“Story!”\r\n\r\nHe seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,\r\nin a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call\r\nour connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific\r\ngentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Not of Beauvais?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\r\ngentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the\r\ngentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.\r\nOur relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that\r\ntime in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years.”\r\n\r\n“At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and\r\nI was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other\r\nFrench gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.\r\nIn a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for\r\nscores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;\r\nthere is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like\r\nsentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my\r\nbusiness life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in\r\nthe course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere\r\nmachine. To go on--”\r\n\r\n“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”--the\r\ncuriously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--“that when I was\r\nleft an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years,\r\nit was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced\r\nto take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then\r\nconducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding\r\nthe chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub\r\nhis chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking\r\ndown into her face while she sat looking up into his.\r\n\r\n“Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself\r\njust now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold\r\nwith my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect\r\nthat I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of\r\nTellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business of\r\nTellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance\r\nof them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary\r\nMangle.”\r\n\r\nAfter this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry\r\nflattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most\r\nunnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was\r\nbefore), and resumed his former attitude.\r\n\r\n“So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your\r\nregretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died\r\nwhen he did--Don’t be frightened! How you start!”\r\n\r\nShe did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.\r\n\r\n“Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from\r\nthe back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped\r\nhim in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation--a matter of\r\nbusiness. As I was saying--”\r\n\r\nHer look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:\r\n\r\n“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly\r\nand silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not\r\nbeen difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could\r\ntrace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a\r\nprivilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid\r\nto speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the\r\nprivilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one\r\nto the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had\r\nimplored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of\r\nhim, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have\r\nbeen the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”\r\n\r\n“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”\r\n\r\n“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this\r\nmoment.”\r\n\r\n“You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That’s good!” (Though\r\nhis manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of business.\r\nRegard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now\r\nif this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,\r\nhad suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was\r\nborn--”\r\n\r\n“The little child was a daughter, sir.”\r\n\r\n“A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don’t be distressed. Miss, if the\r\npoor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,\r\nthat she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the\r\ninheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by\r\nrearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don’t kneel! In\r\nHeaven’s name why should you kneel to me!”\r\n\r\n“For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”\r\n\r\n“A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact\r\nbusiness if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly\r\nmention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many\r\nshillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so\r\nmuch more at my ease about your state of mind.”\r\n\r\nWithout directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had\r\nvery gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp\r\nhis wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she\r\ncommunicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.\r\n\r\n“That’s right, that’s right. Courage! Business! You have business before\r\nyou; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with\r\nyou. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened\r\nher unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,\r\nto grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud\r\nupon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his\r\nheart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.”\r\n\r\nAs he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the\r\nflowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have\r\nbeen already tinged with grey.\r\n\r\n“You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what\r\nthey had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new\r\ndiscovery, of money, or of any other property; but--”\r\n\r\nHe felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the\r\nforehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was\r\nnow immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.\r\n\r\n“But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too\r\nprobable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.\r\nStill, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant\r\nin Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to\r\nrestore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”\r\n\r\nA shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a\r\nlow, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,\r\n\r\n“I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!”\r\n\r\nMr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there,\r\nthere! Se"

		    "text": "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle\r\n\r\nI. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard him\r\nmention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\r\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\r\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\r\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He\r\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\r\nthe world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a\r\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\r\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for\r\ndrawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained\r\nreasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely\r\nadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might\r\nthrow a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\r\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\r\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\r\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\r\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\r\n\r\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\r\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\r\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\r\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\r\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian\r\nsoul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old\r\nbooks, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,\r\nthe drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen\r\nnature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,\r\nand occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of\r\nobservation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\r\nmysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\r\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\r\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up\r\nof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and\r\nfinally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\r\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\r\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\r\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\r\n\r\nOne night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a\r\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\r\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\r\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\r\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\r\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\r\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\r\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\r\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\r\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\r\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\r\nstory. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\r\ndreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\r\nand was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\r\n\r\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\r\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\r\nme to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\r\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\r\nand looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\r\n\r\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\r\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\r\n\r\n“Seven!” I answered.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\r\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\r\nthat you intended to go into harness.”\r\n\r\n“Then, how do you know?”\r\n\r\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\r\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\r\nservant girl?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\r\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\r\ncountry walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\r\nhave changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\r\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\r\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.”\r\n\r\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\r\n\r\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\r\nof your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\r\nscored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\r\nsomeone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\r\norder to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\r\ndeduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\r\nparticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\r\nto your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\r\niodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\r\nforefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\r\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\r\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\r\nprocess of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\r\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\r\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\r\nreasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\r\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\r\ndown into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\r\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\r\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.”\r\n\r\n“Frequently.”\r\n\r\n“How often?”\r\n\r\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\r\n\r\n“Then how many are there?”\r\n\r\n“How many? I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\r\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\r\nboth seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\r\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\r\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\r\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\r\nupon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\r\n\r\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\r\n\r\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\r\nsaid, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\r\ndeepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\r\nEurope have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\r\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\r\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\r\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\r\nwear a mask.”\r\n\r\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\r\nmeans?”\r\n\r\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\r\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\r\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\r\nendeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\r\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\r\nstiff.”\r\n\r\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\r\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\r\n\r\nI did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\r\nwith a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\r\n\r\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\r\nwhich is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\r\nour ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\r\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\r\nfrom his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\r\nGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\r\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\r\nglass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\r\nthat?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\r\nfrom his cigarette.\r\n\r\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\r\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\r\nall quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\r\nthat. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\r\nremains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\r\nwrites upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\r\nface. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\r\ndoubts.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\r\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\r\nwhistled.\r\n\r\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\r\nthe window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\r\nand fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\r\nis nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\r\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\r\n\r\n“But your client—”\r\n\r\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\r\nSit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\r\n\r\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\r\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\r\nauthoritative tap.\r\n\r\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\r\n\r\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\r\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\r\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\r\ntaste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\r\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\r\nthrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\r\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\r\nberyl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\r\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\r\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\r\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\r\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\r\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\r\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\r\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\r\nand a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\r\nof obstinacy.\r\n\r\n“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\r\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\r\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\r\n\r\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\r\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\r\nhave I the honour to address?”\r\n\r\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I\r\nunderstand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and\r\ndiscretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\r\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\r\nmy chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\r\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.”\r\n\r\nThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\r\n“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of\r\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\r\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\r\nEuropean history.”\r\n\r\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\r\n\r\n“And I.”\r\n\r\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\r\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\r\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\r\nnot exactly my own.”\r\n\r\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly.\r\n\r\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to\r\nbe taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\r\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\r\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\r\nkings of Bohemia.”\r\n\r\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\r\nhis armchair and closing his eyes.\r\n\r\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\r\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the\r\nmost incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\r\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\r\n\r\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\r\nshould be better able to advise you.”\r\n\r\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\r\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\r\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”\r\nhe cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I\r\nwas aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\r\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\r\nBohemia.”\r\n\r\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\r\nmore and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can\r\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\r\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\r\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\r\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”\r\n\r\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\r\n\r\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\r\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,\r\nIrene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\r\n\r\n“Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without\r\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\r\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to\r\nname a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\r\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\r\nthat of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\r\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\r\n\r\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858.\r\nContralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw—yes!\r\nRetired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite so! Your\r\nMajesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person,\r\nwrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting\r\nthose letters back.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely so. But how—”\r\n\r\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\r\n\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\r\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\r\nprove their authenticity?”\r\n\r\n“There is the writing.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\r\n\r\n“My private note-paper.”\r\n\r\n“Stolen.”\r\n\r\n“My own seal.”\r\n\r\n“Imitated.”\r\n\r\n“My photograph.”\r\n\r\n“Bought.”\r\n\r\n“We were both in the photograph.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\r\nindiscretion.”\r\n\r\n“I was mad—insane.”\r\n\r\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\r\n\r\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”\r\n\r\n“It must be recovered.”\r\n\r\n“We have tried and failed.”\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\r\n\r\n“She will not sell.”\r\n\r\n“Stolen, then.”\r\n\r\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\r\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\r\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.”\r\n\r\n“No sign of it?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely none.”\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\r\n\r\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\r\n\r\n“To ruin me.”\r\n\r\n“But how?”\r\n\r\n“I am about to be married.”\r\n\r\n“So I have heard.”\r\n\r\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\r\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\r\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\r\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\r\n\r\n“And Irene Adler?”\r\n\r\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\r\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\r\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\r\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no\r\nlengths to which she would not go—none.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\r\n\r\n“I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\r\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is\r\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\r\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\r\npresent?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count\r\nVon Kramm.”\r\n\r\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\r\n\r\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\r\n\r\n“Then, as to money?”\r\n\r\n“You have _carte blanche_.”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely?”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\r\nhave that photograph.”\r\n\r\n“And for present expenses?”\r\n\r\nThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\r\nit on the table.\r\n\r\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the\r\nphotograph a cabinet?”\r\n\r\n“It was.”\r\n\r\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\r\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the\r\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be\r\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like\r\nto chat this little matter over with you.”\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\r\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\r\nshortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire,\r\nhowever, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.\r\nI was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was\r\nsurrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were\r\nassociated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still,\r\nthe nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a\r\ncharacter of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\r\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\r\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\r\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\r\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\r\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\r\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\r\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\r\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my\r\nfriend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three\r\ntimes before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he\r\nvanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\r\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\r\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed\r\nheartily for some minutes.\r\n\r\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he\r\nwas obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\r\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\r\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\r\nI left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the\r\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\r\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\r\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\r\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\r\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\r\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\r\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\r\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\r\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and\r\nexamined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\r\nanything else of interest.\r\n\r\n“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there\r\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\r\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in\r\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\r\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\r\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was\r\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\r\nlisten to.”\r\n\r\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the\r\ndaintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\r\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\r\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\r\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\r\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\r\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\r\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\r\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\r\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I\r\nbegan to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think\r\nover my plan of campaign.\r\n\r\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.\r\nHe was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between\r\nthem, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client,\r\nhis friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably\r\ntransferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less\r\nlikely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should\r\ncontinue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\r\ngentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\r\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\r\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\r\nto understand the situation.”\r\n\r\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\r\n\r\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up\r\nto Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\r\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached—evidently the man of whom\r\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\r\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\r\na man who was thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\r\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\r\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\r\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to\r\nthe cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\r\nearnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &\r\nHankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the\r\nEdgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\r\n\r\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well\r\nto follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman\r\nwith his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all\r\nthe tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t\r\npulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only\r\ncaught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with\r\na face that a man might die for.\r\n\r\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if\r\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.’\r\n\r\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\r\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a\r\ncab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby\r\nfare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St.\r\nMonica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\r\nminutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\r\nclear enough what was in the wind.\r\n\r\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others\r\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\r\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\r\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\r\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\r\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\r\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\r\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\r\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.\r\n\r\n“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’\r\n\r\n“‘What then?’ I asked.\r\n\r\n“‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’\r\n\r\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I\r\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\r\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in\r\nthe secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\r\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\r\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\r\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\r\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it\r\nthat started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some\r\ninformality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused\r\nto marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\r\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\r\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\r\nmean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”\r\n\r\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\r\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\r\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\r\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I\r\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left\r\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\r\nwent off to make my own arrangements.”\r\n\r\n“Which are?”\r\n\r\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I\r\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\r\nthis evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least.”\r\n\r\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\r\n\r\n“Not in a good cause.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\r\n\r\n“Then I am your man.”\r\n\r\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\r\n\r\n“But what is it you wish?”\r\n\r\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you.\r\nNow,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\r\nlandlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\r\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\r\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\r\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\r\n\r\n“And what then?”\r\n\r\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\r\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\r\ncome what may. You understand?”\r\n\r\n“I am to be neutral?”\r\n\r\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\r\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\r\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\r\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\r\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\r\nquite follow me?”\r\n\r\n“Entirely.”\r\n\r\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\r\nroll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted\r\nwith a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\r\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up\r\nby quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\r\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\r\nmyself clear?”\r\n\r\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at\r\nthe signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\r\nto wait you at the corner of the street.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\r\n\r\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\r\nfor the new role I have to play.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the\r\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\r\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\r\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\r\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\r\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\r\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\r\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\r\nspecialist in crime.\r\n\r\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\r\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\r\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\r\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\r\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\r\nSherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be\r\nless private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a\r\nquiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of\r\nshabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\r\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\r\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\r\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\r\n\r\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\r\nhouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\r\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\r\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\r\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\r\nthe photograph?”\r\n\r\n“Where, indeed?”\r\n\r\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\r\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\r\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\r\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\r\nshe does not carry it about with her.”\r\n\r\n“Where, then?”\r\n\r\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\r\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like\r\nto do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else?\r\nShe could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what\r\nindirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\r\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\r\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\r\nin her own house.”\r\n\r\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\r\n\r\n“But how will you look?”\r\n\r\n“I will not look.”\r\n\r\n“What then?”\r\n\r\n“I will get her to show me.”\r\n\r\n“But she will refuse.”\r\n\r\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\r\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the\r\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\r\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\r\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\r\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\r\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\r\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\r\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\r\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\r\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\r\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\r\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,\r\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\r\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\r\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\r\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\r\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\r\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\r\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\r\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\r\n\r\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\r\n\r\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\r\nbefore you can get him to hospital.”\r\n\r\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\r\npurse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\r\nrough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\r\n\r\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\r\n\r\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\r\nThis way, please!”\r\n\r\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\r\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by\r\nthe window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,\r\nso that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know\r\nwhether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he\r\nwas playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\r\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I\r\nwas conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon\r\nthe injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes\r\nto draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened\r\nmy heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I\r\nthought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from\r\ninjuring another.\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\r\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\r\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my\r\nrocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out\r\nof my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\r\nill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids—joined in a general shriek of\r\n“Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the\r\nopen window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later\r\nthe voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\r\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\r\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\r\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\r\nand in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the\r\nquiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.\r\n\r\n“You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\r\nbetter. It is all right.”\r\n\r\n“You have the photograph?”\r\n\r\n“I know where it is.”\r\n\r\n“And how did you find out?”\r\n\r\n“She showed me, as I told you she would.”\r\n\r\n“I am still in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\r\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was\r\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\r\n\r\n“I guessed as much.”\r\n\r\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\r\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\r\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\r\n\r\n“That also I could fathom.”\r\n\r\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\r\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\r\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to\r\nsee which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\r\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\r\n\r\n“How did that help you?”\r\n\r\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\r\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\r\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\r\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\r\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\r\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\r\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\r\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\r\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\r\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\r\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\r\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\r\nshe half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\r\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\r\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\r\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\r\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\r\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\r\n\r\n“And now?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\r\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\r\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\r\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\r\na satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\r\n\r\n“And when will you call?”\r\n\r\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\r\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\r\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\r\ndelay.”\r\n\r\nWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was\r\nsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:\r\n\r\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\r\n\r\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\r\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit\r\nstreet. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\r\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\r\nshoulder and looking eagerly into his face.\r\n\r\n“Not yet.”\r\n\r\n“But you have hopes?”\r\n\r\n“I have hopes.”\r\n\r\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\r\n\r\n“We must have a cab.”\r\n\r\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\r\n\r\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once\r\nmore for Briony Lodge.\r\n\r\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n“Married! When?”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“But to whom?”\r\n\r\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\r\n\r\n“But she could not love him.”\r\n\r\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\r\n\r\n“And why in hopes?”\r\n\r\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\r\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\r\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\r\nyour Majesty’s plan.”\r\n\r\n“It is true. And yet—! Well! I wish she had been of my own station!\r\nWhat a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence,\r\nwhich was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\r\n\r\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the\r\nsteps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\r\nbrougham.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\r\n\r\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\r\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\r\n\r\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\r\nthis morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for\r\nthe Continent.”\r\n\r\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\r\nsurprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”\r\n\r\n“Never to return.”\r\n\r\n“And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\r\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\r\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\r\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\r\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,\r\nplunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\r\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\r\nsuperscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\r\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\r\nmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very well. You took\r\n    me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a\r\n    suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I\r\n    began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had\r\n    been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly\r\n    be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you\r\n    made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became\r\n    suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old\r\n    clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.\r\n    Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the\r\n    freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you,\r\n    ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came\r\n    down just as you departed.\r\n\r\n    “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\r\n    really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\r\n    Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for\r\n    the Temple to see my husband.\r\n\r\n    “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so\r\n    formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you\r\n    call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in\r\n    peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do\r\n    what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly\r\n    wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a\r\n    weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might\r\n    take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to\r\n    possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n    “IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had\r\nall three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute\r\nshe was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity\r\nthat she was not on my level?”\r\n\r\n“From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very\r\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that\r\nI have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more\r\nsuccessful conclusion.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\r\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\r\nsafe as if it were in the fire.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\r\n\r\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\r\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\r\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”\r\nsaid Holmes.\r\n\r\n“You have but to name it.”\r\n\r\n“This photograph!”\r\n\r\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”\r\n\r\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\r\nI have the honour to wish you a very good morning.” He bowed, and,\r\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\r\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\r\n\r\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\r\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a\r\nwoman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I\r\nhave not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or\r\nwhen he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable\r\ntitle of _the_ woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\r\n\r\n\r\n I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the\r\n autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very\r\n stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an\r\n apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled\r\n me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\r\n\r\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he\r\nsaid cordially.\r\n\r\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\r\n\r\n“So I am. Very much so.”\r\n\r\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\r\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\r\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\r\n\r\nThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of\r\ngreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small\r\nfat-en"

		    "text": "Ulysses, by James Joyce\r\n\r\n— I —\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 1 ]\r\n\r\nStately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of\r\nlather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow\r\ndressinggown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild\r\nmorning air. He held the bowl aloft and intoned:\r\n\r\n—_Introibo ad altare Dei_.\r\n\r\nHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:\r\n\r\n—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!\r\n\r\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\r\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\r\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\r\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat\r\nand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned\r\nhis arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking\r\ngurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light\r\nuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the\r\nbowl smartly.\r\n\r\n—Back to barracks! he said sternly.\r\n\r\nHe added in a preacher’s tone:\r\n\r\n—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul\r\nand blood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One\r\nmoment. A little trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.\r\n\r\nHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\r\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and\r\nthere with gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles\r\nanswered through the calm.\r\n\r\n—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off\r\nthe current, will you?\r\n\r\nHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\r\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\r\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.\r\nA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.\r\n\r\n—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!\r\n\r\nHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\r\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\r\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as\r\nhe propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\r\nlathered cheeks and neck.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.\r\n\r\n—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\r\nHellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself. We\r\nmust go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out\r\ntwenty quid?\r\n\r\nHe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:\r\n\r\n—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!\r\n\r\nCeasing, he began to shave with care.\r\n\r\n—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.\r\n\r\n—Yes, my love?\r\n\r\n—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.\r\n\r\n—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\r\nyou’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\r\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\r\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you\r\nis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.\r\n\r\nHe shaved warily over his chin.\r\n\r\n—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\r\nhis guncase?\r\n\r\n—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?\r\n\r\n—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\r\nwith a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\r\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If\r\nhe stays on here I am off.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\r\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.\r\n\r\n—Scutter! he cried thickly.\r\n\r\nHe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper\r\npocket, said:\r\n\r\n—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.\r\n\r\nStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\r\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\r\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\r\n\r\n—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\r\nYou can almost taste it, can’t you?\r\n\r\nHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\r\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\r\n\r\n—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\r\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. _Epi oinopa\r\nponton_. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them\r\nin the original. _Thalatta! Thalatta!_ She is our great sweet mother.\r\nCome and look.\r\n\r\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\r\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\r\nKingstown.\r\n\r\n—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t\r\nlet me have anything to do with you.\r\n\r\n—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.\r\n\r\n—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother\r\nasked you, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to\r\nthink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and\r\npray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....\r\n\r\nHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\r\nsmile curled his lips.\r\n\r\n—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\r\nmummer of them all!\r\n\r\nHe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.\r\n\r\nStephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\r\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\r\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently,\r\nin a dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within\r\nits loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood,\r\nher breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\r\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\r\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay and\r\nskyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had\r\nstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had\r\ntorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.\r\n\r\n—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt\r\nand a few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?\r\n\r\n—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.\r\n\r\n—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\r\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\r\nstripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You\r\nlook damn well when you’re dressed.\r\n\r\n—Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.\r\n\r\n—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\r\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\r\nsmooth skin.\r\n\r\nStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\r\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.\r\n\r\n—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan,\r\nsays you have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman.\r\nGeneral paralysis of the insane!\r\n\r\nHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings\r\nabroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips\r\nlaughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized\r\nall his strong wellknit trunk.\r\n\r\n—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\r\n\r\nStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by\r\na crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this\r\nface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.\r\n\r\n—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\r\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi.\r\nLead him not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.\r\n\r\nLaughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.\r\n\r\n—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\r\nWilde were only alive to see you!\r\n\r\nDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:\r\n\r\n—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him\r\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\r\nhad thrust them.\r\n\r\n—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly.\r\nGod knows you have more spirit than any of them.\r\n\r\nParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\r\ncold steel pen.\r\n\r\n—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap\r\ndownstairs and touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and\r\nthinks you’re not a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling\r\njalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and\r\nI could only work together we might do something for the island.\r\nHellenise it.\r\n\r\nCranly’s arm. His arm.\r\n\r\n—And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one\r\nthat knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you up\r\nyour nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll\r\nbring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave\r\nClive Kempthorpe.\r\n\r\nYoung shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:\r\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\r\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\r\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\r\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\r\ntailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t\r\nwant to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!\r\n\r\nShouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\r\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower\r\non the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\r\n\r\nTo ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.\r\n\r\n—Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m\r\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?\r\n\r\nThey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on\r\nthe water like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.\r\n\r\n—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.\r\n\r\nHe looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\r\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\r\nanxiety in his eyes.\r\n\r\nStephen, depressed by his own voice, said:\r\n\r\n—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:\r\n\r\n—What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and\r\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?\r\n\r\n—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to get\r\nmore hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the\r\ndrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.\r\n\r\n—Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.\r\n\r\n—You said, Stephen answered, _O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is\r\nbeastly dead._\r\n\r\nA flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\r\nMulligan’s cheek.\r\n\r\n—Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?\r\n\r\nHe shook his constraint from him nervously.\r\n\r\n—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You saw\r\nonly your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\r\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly\r\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel\r\ndown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?\r\nBecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected\r\nthe wrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes\r\nare not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks\r\nbuttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her\r\nlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like\r\nsome hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I\r\ndidn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping\r\nwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:\r\n\r\n—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.\r\n\r\n—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.\r\n\r\n—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan swung round on his heel.\r\n\r\n—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\r\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now\r\ngrew dim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he\r\nfelt the fever of his cheeks.\r\n\r\nA voice within the tower called loudly:\r\n\r\n—Are you up there, Mulligan?\r\n\r\n—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards Stephen and said:\r\n\r\n—Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola,\r\nKinch, and come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.\r\n\r\nHis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\r\nwith the roof:\r\n\r\n—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the\r\nmoody brooding.\r\n\r\nHis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of\r\nthe stairhead:\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood\r\n     Upon love’s bitter mystery\r\n     For Fergus rules the brazen cars.\r\n\r\nWoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\r\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\r\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the\r\ndim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\r\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\r\nshimmering on the dim tide.\r\n\r\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\r\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’\r\nsong: I sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords.\r\nHer door was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and\r\npity I went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For\r\nthose words, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.\r\n\r\nWhere now?\r\n\r\nHer secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,\r\na gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the\r\nsunny window of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing\r\nin the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n     I am the boy\r\n     That can enjoy\r\n     Invisibility.\r\n\r\nPhantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood.\r\n\r\n\r\nFolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\r\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\r\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\r\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\r\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s\r\nshirts.\r\n\r\nIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\r\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\r\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\r\n\r\nHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On\r\nme alone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the\r\ntortured face. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all\r\nprayed on their knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. _Liliata\r\nrutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum\r\nchorus excipiat._\r\n\r\nGhoul! Chewer of corpses!\r\n\r\nNo, mother! Let me be and let me live.\r\n\r\n—Kinch ahoy!\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\r\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,\r\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\r\n\r\n—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\r\napologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.\r\n\r\n—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.\r\n\r\n—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\r\nsakes.\r\n\r\nHis head disappeared and reappeared.\r\n\r\n—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch\r\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.\r\n\r\n—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.\r\n\r\n—If you want it, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have\r\na glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\r\ntune with a Cockney accent:\r\n\r\n     O, won’t we have a merry time,\r\n     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!\r\n     On coronation,\r\n     Coronation day!\r\n     O, won’t we have a merry time\r\n     On coronation day!\r\n\r\nWarm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\r\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it\r\nthere all day, forgotten friendship?\r\n\r\nHe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\r\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.\r\nSo I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now\r\nand yet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.\r\n\r\nIn the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form\r\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\r\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\r\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\r\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.\r\n\r\n—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?\r\n\r\nStephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\r\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\r\nthe inner doors.\r\n\r\n—Have you the key? a voice asked.\r\n\r\n—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!\r\n\r\nHe howled, without looking up from the fire:\r\n\r\n—Kinch!\r\n\r\n—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.\r\n\r\nThe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been\r\nset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the\r\ndoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and\r\nsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside\r\nhim. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set\r\nthem down heavily and sighed with relief.\r\n\r\n—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a\r\nword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey.\r\nHaines, come in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy\r\ngifts. Where’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.\r\n\r\nStephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\r\nthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.\r\n\r\n—What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.\r\n\r\n—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the\r\nlocker.\r\n\r\n—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nHaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:\r\n\r\n—That woman is coming up with the milk.\r\n\r\n—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his\r\nchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,\r\nI can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.\r\n\r\nHe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three\r\nplates, saying:\r\n\r\n—_In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti._\r\n\r\nHaines sat down to pour out the tea.\r\n\r\n—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do\r\nmake strong tea, don’t you?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old\r\nwoman’s wheedling voice:\r\n\r\n—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I\r\nmakes water I makes water.\r\n\r\n—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:\r\n\r\n—_So I do, Mrs Cahill,_ says she. _Begob, ma’am,_ says Mrs Cahill, _God\r\nsend you don’t make them in the one pot._\r\n\r\nHe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\r\non his knife.\r\n\r\n—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five lines\r\nof text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\r\nDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\r\nbrows:\r\n\r\n—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken\r\nof in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?\r\n\r\n—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.\r\n\r\n—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?\r\n\r\n—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\r\nMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.\r\n\r\n—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth\r\nand blinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\r\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:\r\n\r\n_—For old Mary Ann\r\n\r\nShe doesn’t care a damn.\r\n\r\nBut, hising up her petticoats..._\r\n\r\nHe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.\r\n\r\nThe doorway was darkened by an entering form.\r\n\r\n—The milk, sir!\r\n\r\n—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.\r\n\r\nAn old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.\r\n\r\n—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.\r\n\r\n—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!\r\n\r\nStephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.\r\n\r\n—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of\r\nthe collector of prepuces.\r\n\r\n—How much, sir? asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n—A quart, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\r\nmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and a\r\ntilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe a\r\nmessenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\r\nCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on\r\nher toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They\r\nlowed about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and\r\npoor old woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly\r\nform of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their\r\ncommon cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to\r\nupbraid, whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\r\n\r\n—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.\r\n\r\n—Taste it, sir, she said.\r\n\r\nHe drank at her bidding.\r\n\r\n—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\r\nloudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\r\nguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved\r\nwith dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.\r\n\r\n—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\r\n\r\n—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n\r\n—Look at that now, she said.\r\n\r\nStephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\r\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\r\nslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\r\nis of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in\r\nGod’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids\r\nher be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\r\n\r\n—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.\r\n\r\n—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.\r\n\r\nHaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\r\n\r\n—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?\r\n\r\n—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the\r\nwest, sir?\r\n\r\n—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.\r\n\r\n—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak\r\nIrish in Ireland.\r\n\r\n—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak\r\nthe language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.\r\n\r\n—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\r\nus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?\r\n\r\n—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\r\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.\r\n\r\nHaines said to her:\r\n\r\n—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?\r\n\r\nStephen filled again the three cups.\r\n\r\n—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at\r\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\r\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a\r\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\r\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search\r\nhis trouser pockets.\r\n\r\n—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.\r\n\r\nStephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\r\nthick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\r\nhis fingers and cried:\r\n\r\n—A miracle!\r\n\r\nHe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\r\n\r\n—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.\r\n\r\nStephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\r\n\r\n—We’ll owe twopence, he said.\r\n\r\n—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good\r\nmorning, sir.\r\n\r\nShe curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:\r\n\r\n_—Heart of my heart, were it more,\r\n\r\nMore would be laid at your feet._\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and said:\r\n\r\n—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring\r\nus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\r\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.\r\n\r\n—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\r\nnational library today.\r\n\r\n—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and asked blandly:\r\n\r\n—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?\r\n\r\nThen he said to Haines:\r\n\r\n—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\r\n\r\n—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\r\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.\r\n\r\nHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\r\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\r\n\r\n—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\r\nConscience. Yet here’s a spot.\r\n\r\n—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\r\nof Irish art is deuced good.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with\r\nwarmth of tone:\r\n\r\n—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.\r\n\r\n—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\r\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\r\n\r\n—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\nHaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\r\nthe hammock, said:\r\n\r\n—I don’t know, I’m sure.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen\r\nand said with coarse vigour:\r\n\r\n—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?\r\n\r\n—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\r\nmilkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.\r\n\r\n—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\r\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\r\n\r\n—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.\r\n\r\n—From me, Kinch, he said.\r\n\r\nIn a suddenly changed tone he added:\r\n\r\n—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they\r\nare good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.\r\nLet us get out of the kip.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\r\nresignedly:\r\n\r\n—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his pockets on to the table.\r\n\r\n—There’s your snotrag, he said.\r\n\r\nAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\r\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\r\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\r\nwe’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and green\r\nboots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\r\ncontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\r\nhis talking hands.\r\n\r\n—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.\r\n\r\nStephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\r\ndoorway:\r\n\r\n—Are you coming, you fellows?\r\n\r\n—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,\r\nKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out\r\nwith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\r\n\r\n—And going forth he met Butterly.\r\n\r\nStephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\r\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\r\nlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:\r\n\r\n—Did you bring the key?\r\n\r\n—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.\r\n\r\nHe walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\r\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\r\n\r\n—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!\r\n\r\nHaines asked:\r\n\r\n—Do you pay rent for this tower?\r\n\r\n—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\n—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\r\n\r\n—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?\r\n\r\n—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on\r\nthe sea. But ours is the _omphalos_.\r\n\r\n—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.\r\n\r\n—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas\r\nand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I\r\nhave a few pints in me first.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\r\nprimrose waistcoat:\r\n\r\n—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?\r\n\r\n—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\r\n\r\n—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?\r\n\r\n—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\r\nIt’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is\r\nShakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\r\nloose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:\r\n\r\n—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!\r\n\r\n—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is\r\nrather long to tell.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\r\n\r\n—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.\r\n\r\n—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this\r\ntower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. _That\r\nbeetles o’er his base into the sea,_ isn’t it?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did\r\nnot speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in\r\ncheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.\r\n\r\n—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.\r\n\r\nEyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\r\nThe seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\r\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\r\ntacking by the Muglins.\r\n\r\n—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\r\nThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked\r\nat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\r\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved\r\na doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and\r\nbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\r\n\r\n_—I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\r\nMy mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.\r\nWith Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.\r\nSo here’s to disciples and Calvary._\r\n\r\nHe held up a forefinger of warning.\r\n\r\n_—If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine\r\nHe’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine\r\nBut have to drink water and wish it were plain\r\nThat I make when the wine becomes water again._\r\n\r\nHe tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running\r\nforward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like\r\nfins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\r\n\r\n_—Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said\r\nAnd tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.\r\nWhat’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\r\nAnd Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!_\r\n\r\nHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\r\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh\r\nwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\r\n\r\nHaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a\r\nbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of\r\nit somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?\r\n\r\n—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\n—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?\r\n\r\n—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.\r\n\r\n—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in\r\nthe narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\r\npersonal God.\r\n\r\n—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\r\ngreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\r\n\r\n—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.\r\n\r\nHaines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\r\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\r\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\r\ntowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.\r\n\r\n—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or\r\nyou don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a\r\npersonal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?\r\n\r\n—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\r\nexample of free thought.\r\n\r\nHe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\r\nside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\r\nMy familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line\r\nalong the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\r\nHe wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt\r\nbread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n—After all, Haines began...\r\n\r\nStephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was\r\nnot all unkind.\r\n\r\n—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\r\nown master, it seems to me.\r\n\r\n—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an\r\nItalian.\r\n\r\n—Italian? Haines said.\r\n\r\nA crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.\r\n\r\n—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\r\n\r\n—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?\r\n\r\n—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\r\nthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\r\n\r\nHaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\r\nlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you\r\nrather unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\r\n\r\nThe proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of\r\ntheir brazen bells: _et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam\r\necclesiam:_ the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own\r\nrare thoughts, a chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass\r\nfor pope Marcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in\r\naffirmation: and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church\r\nmilitant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies\r\nfleeing with mitres awry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom\r\nMulligan was one, and Arius, warring his life long upon the\r\nconsubstantiality of the Son with the Father, and Valentine, spurning\r\nChrist’s terrene body, and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who\r\nheld that the Father was Himself His own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken\r\na moment since in mockery to the stranger. Idle mockery. The void\r\nawaits surely all them that weave the wind: a menace, a disarming and a\r\nworsting from those embattled angels of the church, Michael’s host, who\r\ndefend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their\r\nshields.\r\n\r\nHear, hear! Prolonged applause. _Zut! Nom de Dieu!_\r\n\r\n—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I\r\ndon’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.\r\nThat’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.\r\n\r\nTwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman,\r\nboatman.\r\n\r\n—She’s making for Bullock harbour.\r\n\r\nThe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.\r\n\r\n—There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way\r\nwhen the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.\r\n\r\nThe man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting\r\nfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,\r\nsaltwhite. Here I am.\r\n\r\nThey followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood\r\non a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his\r\nshoulder. A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly\r\nfrogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.\r\n\r\n—Is the brother with you, Malachi?\r\n\r\n—Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.\r\n\r\n—Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young\r\nthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.\r\n\r\n—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near\r\nthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,\r\nwater glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water\r\nrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black\r\nsagging loincloth.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines\r\nand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and\r\nlips and breastbone.\r\n\r\n—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of\r\nrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.\r\n\r\n—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\n—Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?\r\n\r\n—Yes.\r\n\r\n—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n—Is she up the pole?\r\n\r\n—Better ask Seymour that.\r\n\r\n—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying\r\ntritely:\r\n\r\n—Redheaded women buck like goats.\r\n\r\nHe broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.\r\n\r\n—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the _Übermensch._ Toothless\r\nKinch and I, the supermen.\r\n\r\nHe struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his\r\nclothes lay.\r\n\r\n—Are you going in here, Malachi?\r\n\r\n—Yes. Make room in the bed.\r\n\r\nThe young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the\r\nmiddle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a\r\nstone, smoking.\r\n\r\n—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.\r\n\r\n—Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.\r\n\r\nStephen turned away.\r\n\r\n—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.\r\n\r\n—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.\r\n\r\nStephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n—And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.\r\n\r\nStephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck\r\nMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:\r\n\r\n—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake\r\nZarathustra.\r\n\r\nHis plump body plunged.\r\n\r\n—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the\r\npath and smiling at wild Irish.\r\n\r\nHorn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.\r\n\r\n—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.\r\n\r\n—Good, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the upwardcurving path.\r\n\r\n     Liliata rutilantium.\r\n     Turma circumdet.\r\n     Iubilantium te virginum.\r\n\r\nThe priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will\r\nnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.\r\n\r\nA voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning\r\nthe curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a\r\nseal’s, far out on the water, round.\r\n\r\nUsurper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 2 ]\r\n\r\n\r\n—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?\r\n\r\n—Tarentum, sir.\r\n\r\n—Very good. Well?\r\n\r\n—There was a battle, sir.\r\n\r\n—Very good. Where?\r\n\r\nThe boy’s blank face asked the blank window.\r\n\r\nFabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as\r\nmemory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings\r\nof excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling\r\nmasonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?\r\n\r\n—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.\r\n\r\n—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the\r\ngorescarred book.\r\n\r\n—Yes, sir. And he said: _Another victory like that and we are done\r\nfor._\r\n\r\nThat phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From a\r\nhill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,\r\nleaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.\r\n\r\n—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?\r\n\r\n—End of Pyrrhus, sir?\r\n\r\n—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.\r\n\r\n—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?\r\n\r\nA bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them\r\nbetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered\r\nto the tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people,\r\nproud that their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.\r\n\r\n—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.\r\n\r\nAll laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round\r\nat his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh\r\nmore loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.\r\n\r\n—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,\r\nwhat is a pier.\r\n\r\n—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a\r\nbridge. Kingstown pier, sir.\r\n\r\nSome laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench\r\nwhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.\r\nAll. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their\r\nlikes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets\r\ntittering in the struggle.\r\n\r\n—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.\r\n\r\nThe words troubled their gaze.\r\n\r\n—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.\r\n\r\nFor Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild\r\ndrink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A\r\njester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a\r\nclement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly\r\nfor the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other\r\ntoo often heard, their land a pawnshop.\r\n\r\nHad Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not\r\nbeen knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has branded\r\nthem and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite\r\npossibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing\r\nthat they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?\r\nWeave, weaver of the wind.\r\n\r\n—Tell us a story, sir.\r\n\r\n—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.\r\n\r\n—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.\r\n\r\n—_Weep no more,_ Comyn said.\r\n\r\n—Go on then, Talbot.\r\n\r\n—And the story, sir?\r\n\r\n—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.\r\n\r\nA swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork\r\nof his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:\r\n\r\n_—Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more\r\nFor Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,\r\nSunk though he be beneath the watery floor..._\r\n\r\nIt must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.\r\nAristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated\r\nout into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where\r\nhe had read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his\r\nelbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding\r\nbrains about me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating\r\nfeelers: and in my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld,\r\nreluctant, shy of brightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought\r\nis the thought of thought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner\r\nall that is: the soul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast,\r\ncandescent: form of forms.\r\n\r\nTalbot repeated:\r\n\r\n_—Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,\r\n\r\nThrough the dear might..._\r\n\r\n—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.\r\n\r\n—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.\r\n\r\nHis hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having\r\njust remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these\r\ncraven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and\r\non mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the\r\ntribute. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long look\r\nfrom dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the\r\nchurch’s looms. Ay.\r\n\r\n     Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.\r\n     My father gave me seeds to sow.\r\n\r\nTalbot slid his closed book into his satchel.\r\n\r\n—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.\r\n\r\n—Half day, sir. Thursday.\r\n\r\n—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\nThey bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.\r\nCrowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all\r\ngabbling gaily:\r\n\r\n—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.\r\n\r\n—O, ask me, sir.\r\n\r\n—A hard one, sir.\r\n\r\n—This is the riddle, Stephen said:\r\n\r\n     The cock crew,\r\n     The sky was blue:\r\n     The bells in heaven\r\n     Were striking eleven.\r\n     ’Tis time for this poor soul\r\n     To go to heaven.\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n—What, sir?\r\n\r\n—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence\r\nCochrane said:\r\n\r\n—What is it, sir? We give it up.\r\n\r\nStephen, his throat itching, answered:\r\n\r\n—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries\r\nechoed dismay.\r\n\r\nA stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:\r\n\r\n—Hockey!\r\n\r\nThey broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly\r\nthey were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and\r\nclamour of their boots and tongues.\r\n\r\nSargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open\r\ncopybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness\r\nand through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his\r\ncheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent\r\nand damp as a snail’s bed.\r\n\r\nHe held out his copybook. The word _Sums_ was written on the headline.\r\nBeneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with\r\nblind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.\r\n\r\n—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them\r\nto you, sir.\r\n\r\nStephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.\r\n\r\n—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.\r\n\r\n—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to\r\ncopy them off the board, sir.\r\n\r\n—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n—No, sir.\r\n\r\nUgly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a\r\nsnail’s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in\r\nher heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him\r\nunderfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had l"

		    "text": "War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy\r\n\r\nBOOK ONE: 1805\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n“Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the\r\nBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war,\r\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\r\nAntichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing\r\nmore to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my\r\n‘faithful slave,’ as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I\r\nhave frightened you—sit down and tell me all the news.”\r\n\r\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna\r\nSchérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna.\r\nWith these words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high\r\nrank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna\r\nPávlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering\r\nfrom la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used\r\nonly by the elite.\r\n\r\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\r\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\r\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\r\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette\r\nSchérer.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the\r\nleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\r\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\r\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\r\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\r\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\r\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna,\r\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\r\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\r\n\r\n“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s\r\nmind at rest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the\r\npoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony\r\ncould be discerned.\r\n\r\n“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times\r\nlike these if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are\r\nstaying the whole evening, I hope?”\r\n\r\n“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I\r\nmust put in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is\r\ncoming for me to take me there.”\r\n\r\n“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these\r\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.”\r\n\r\n“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have\r\nbeen put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force\r\nof habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s\r\ndispatch? You know everything.”\r\n\r\n“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless\r\ntone. “What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\r\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”\r\n\r\nPrince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\r\npart. Anna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\r\noverflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\r\nbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not\r\nfeel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the\r\nexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it\r\ndid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,\r\nas in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,\r\nwhich she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst\r\nout:\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand\r\nthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She\r\nis betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign\r\nrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one\r\nthing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform\r\nthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will\r\nnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of\r\nrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of\r\nthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just\r\none.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial\r\nspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander’s\r\nloftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to\r\nfind, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer\r\ndid Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot\r\nunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for\r\nhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\r\npromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\r\nperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and\r\nthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a\r\nword that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian\r\nneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty\r\ndestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!”\r\n\r\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\r\n\r\n“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been\r\nsent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King\r\nof Prussia’s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me\r\na cup of tea?”\r\n\r\n“In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am\r\nexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who\r\nis connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\r\nFrench families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And\r\nalso the Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been\r\nreceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?”\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But\r\ntell me,” he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just\r\noccurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief\r\nmotive of his visit, “is it true that the Dowager Empress wants\r\nBaron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all\r\naccounts is a poor creature.”\r\n\r\nPrince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\r\ntrying through the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for\r\nthe baron.\r\n\r\nAnna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\r\nanyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was\r\npleased with.\r\n\r\n“Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\r\nsister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\r\n\r\nAs she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an\r\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\r\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\r\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\r\nbeaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\r\n\r\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\r\ncourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna\r\nwished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man\r\nrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\r\nout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\r\nbeautiful.”\r\n\r\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\r\n\r\n“I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\r\nto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political\r\nand social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate\r\nconversation—“I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life\r\nare distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?\r\nI don’t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don’t like him,” she\r\nadded in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.\r\n“Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than\r\nanyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”\r\n\r\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\r\n\r\n“I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I\r\nlack the bump of paternity.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know\r\nI am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her\r\nface assumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her\r\nMajesty’s and you were pitied....”\r\n\r\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\r\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\r\n\r\n“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all\r\na father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\r\nHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\r\nis the only difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way\r\nmore natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round\r\nhis mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and\r\nunpleasant.\r\n\r\n“And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\r\nfather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna\r\nPávlovna, looking up pensively.\r\n\r\n“I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\r\nchildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\r\nis how I explain it to myself. It can’t be helped!”\r\n\r\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\r\ngesture. Anna Pávlovna meditated.\r\n\r\n“Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she\r\nasked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I\r\ndon’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who\r\nis very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess\r\nMary Bolkónskaya.”\r\n\r\nPrince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\r\nperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of\r\nthe head that he was considering this information.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\r\ncurrent of his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand\r\nrubles a year? And,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in\r\nfive years, if he goes on like this?” Presently he added: “That’s\r\nwhat we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours\r\nrich?”\r\n\r\n“Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is\r\nthe well-known Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under\r\nthe late Emperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is\r\nvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.\r\nShe has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.\r\nHe is an aide-de-camp of Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna\r\nPávlovna’s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange\r\nthat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe\r\nwith an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich\r\nand of good family and that’s all I want.”\r\n\r\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\r\nmaid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro\r\nas he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\r\n\r\n“Attendez,” said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to\r\nLise, young Bolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the\r\nthing can be arranged. It shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll\r\nstart my apprenticeship as old maid.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAnna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest\r\nPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age\r\nand character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.\r\nPrince Vasíli’s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her\r\nfather to the ambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and\r\nher badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya,\r\nknown as la femme la plus séduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there.\r\nShe had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did\r\nnot go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince\r\nVasíli’s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.\r\nThe Abbé Morio and many others had also come.\r\n\r\n     * The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\r\n\r\nTo each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my\r\naunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted\r\nhim or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her\r\ncap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests\r\nbegan to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her\r\naunt, Anna Pávlovna mentioned each one’s name and then left them.\r\n\r\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not\r\none of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them\r\ncared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and\r\nsolemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in\r\nthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her\r\nMajesty, “who, thank God, was better today.” And each visitor,\r\nthough politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman\r\nwith a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not\r\nreturn to her the whole evening.\r\n\r\nThe young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a\r\ngold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a\r\ndelicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth,\r\nbut it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she\r\noccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case\r\nwith a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her\r\nupper lip and her half-open mouth—seemed to be her own special and\r\npeculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty\r\nyoung woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and\r\ncarrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones\r\nwho looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a\r\nlittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life\r\nand health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile\r\nand the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a\r\nspecially amiable mood that day.\r\n\r\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying\r\nsteps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat\r\ndown on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a\r\npleasure to herself and to all around her. “I have brought my work,”\r\nsaid she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present.\r\n“Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,”\r\nshe added, turning to her hostess. “You wrote that it was to be quite\r\na small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.” And she\r\nspread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray\r\ndress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.\r\n\r\n“Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone\r\nelse,” replied Anna Pávlovna.\r\n\r\n“You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in\r\nFrench, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going\r\nto get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she\r\nadded, addressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she\r\nturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.\r\n\r\n“What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince\r\nVasíli to Anna Pávlovna.\r\n\r\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with\r\nclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable\r\nat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout\r\nyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known\r\ngrandee of Catherine’s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man\r\nhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only\r\njust returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his\r\nfirst appearance in society. Anna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she\r\naccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of\r\nthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight\r\nof something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face\r\nwhen she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than\r\nthe other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to\r\nthe clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which\r\ndistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.\r\n\r\n“It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor\r\ninvalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her\r\naunt as she conducted him to her.\r\n\r\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as\r\nif in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little\r\nprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAnna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the\r\naunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s health.\r\nAnna Pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the\r\nAbbé Morio? He is a most interesting man.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very\r\ninteresting but hardly feasible.”\r\n\r\n“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something\r\nand get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now\r\ncommitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before\r\nshe had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to\r\nanother who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet\r\nspread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s\r\nplan chimerical.\r\n\r\n“We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.\r\n\r\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she\r\nresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready\r\nto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As\r\nthe foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes\r\nround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that\r\ncreaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the\r\nmachine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her\r\ndrawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a\r\nword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,\r\nproper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about\r\nPierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached\r\nthe group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and\r\nagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé.\r\n\r\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna\r\nPávlovna’s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all\r\nthe intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a\r\nchild in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing\r\nany clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident\r\nand refined expression on the faces of those present he was always\r\nexpecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio.\r\nHere the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an\r\nopportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAnna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed\r\nsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,\r\nbeside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face\r\nwas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had\r\nsettled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round\r\nthe abbé. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful\r\nPrincess Hélène, Prince Vasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess\r\nBolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age.\r\nThe third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pávlovna.\r\n\r\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished\r\nmanners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of\r\npoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in\r\nwhich he found himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as\r\na treat to her guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a\r\nspecially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in\r\nthe kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to\r\nher guests, first the vicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice\r\nmorsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the\r\nmurder of the Duc d’Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien\r\nhad perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular\r\nreasons for Buonaparte’s hatred of him.\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna,\r\nwith a pleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in the\r\nsound of that sentence: “Contez nous çela, Vicomte.”\r\n\r\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to\r\ncomply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to\r\nlisten to his tale.\r\n\r\n“The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to\r\none of the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she\r\nto another. “How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she\r\nto a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest\r\nand most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef\r\non a hot dish.\r\n\r\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\r\n\r\n“Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the\r\nbeautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of\r\nanother group.\r\n\r\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which\r\nshe had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful\r\nwoman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss\r\nand ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling\r\ndiamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking\r\nat any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the\r\nprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders,\r\nback, and bosom—which in the fashion of those days were very much\r\nexposed—and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as\r\nshe moved toward Anna Pávlovna. Hélène was so lovely that not only\r\ndid she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even\r\nappeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She\r\nseemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.\r\n\r\n“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his\r\nshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary\r\nwhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her\r\nunchanging smile.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,\r\nsmilingly inclining his head.\r\n\r\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered\r\na reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was\r\nbeing told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,\r\naltered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more\r\nbeautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time\r\nto time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story\r\nproduced an effect she glanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just\r\nthe expression she saw on the maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed\r\ninto her radiant smile.\r\n\r\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène.\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you\r\nthinking of?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my\r\nworkbag.”\r\n\r\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking\r\nmerrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her\r\nseat.\r\n\r\n“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she\r\ntook up her work.\r\n\r\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and\r\nmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\r\n\r\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance\r\nto his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of\r\nthis resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his\r\nsister’s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous,\r\nself-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the\r\nwonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary\r\nwas dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen\r\nself-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and\r\nmouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms\r\nand legs always fell into unnatural positions.\r\n\r\n“It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside\r\nthe princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this\r\ninstrument he could not begin to speak.\r\n\r\n“Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone\r\nwhich showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he\r\nhad uttered them.\r\n\r\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure\r\nwhether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in\r\na dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe\r\neffrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\r\n\r\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current,\r\nto the effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to\r\nvisit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte,\r\nwho also enjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence\r\nNapoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was\r\nsubject, and was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and\r\nthis magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\r\n\r\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point\r\nwhere the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\n“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the\r\nlittle princess.\r\n\r\n“Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into\r\nher work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story\r\nprevented her from going on with it.\r\n\r\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully\r\nprepared to continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a\r\nwatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was\r\ntalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the\r\nrescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about\r\nthe balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young\r\nman’s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both\r\nwere talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why\r\nAnna Pávlovna disapproved.\r\n\r\n“The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of\r\nthe people,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for one\r\npowerful nation like Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place\r\nherself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object\r\nthe maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the\r\nworld!”\r\n\r\n“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.\r\n\r\nAt that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,\r\nasked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s\r\nface instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary\r\nexpression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.\r\n\r\n“I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the\r\nsociety, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had\r\nthe honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of\r\nthe climate,” said he.\r\n\r\nNot letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more\r\nconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the\r\nlarger circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nJust then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew\r\nBolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome young\r\nman, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about\r\nhim, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,\r\noffered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was\r\nevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had\r\nfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to\r\nthem. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed\r\nto bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from\r\nher with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna\r\nPávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.\r\n\r\n“You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.\r\n\r\n“General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing\r\nthe last syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been\r\npleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....”\r\n\r\n“And Lise, your wife?”\r\n\r\n“She will go to the country.”\r\n\r\n“Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”\r\n\r\n“André,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same\r\ncoquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has\r\nbeen telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!”\r\n\r\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from\r\nthe moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,\r\naffectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round\r\nPrince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was\r\ntouching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an\r\nunexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n“There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to\r\nPierre.\r\n\r\n“I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper\r\nwith you. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the\r\nvicomte who was continuing his story.\r\n\r\n“No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing\r\nPierre’s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He\r\nwished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his\r\ndaughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.\r\n\r\n“You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the\r\nFrenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent\r\nhis rising. “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me\r\nof a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave\r\nyour enchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.\r\n\r\nHis daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly\r\nholding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more\r\nradiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,\r\nalmost frightened, eyes as she passed him.\r\n\r\n“Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.\r\n\r\n“Very,” said Pierre.\r\n\r\nIn passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna\r\nPávlovna: “Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me\r\na whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.\r\nNothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever\r\nwomen.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his\r\nfather to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The elderly lady who\r\nhad been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince\r\nVasíli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed\r\nhad left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety\r\nand fear.\r\n\r\n“How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into\r\nthe anteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what\r\nnews I may take back to my poor boy.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely\r\nto the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an\r\ningratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he\r\nwould be transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince\r\nVasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should\r\nadvise you to appeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would\r\nbe the best way.”\r\n\r\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the\r\nbest families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of\r\nsociety had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to\r\nPetersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son.\r\nIt was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an\r\ninvitation to Anna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to\r\nthe vicomte’s story. Prince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an\r\nembittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;\r\nthen she smiled again and clutched Prince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you\r\nfor anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my\r\nfather’s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to\r\ndo this for my son—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,”\r\nshe added hurriedly. “No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked\r\nGolítsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,”\r\nshe said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her\r\nbeautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she\r\nstood waiting by the door.\r\n\r\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized\r\nif it is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized\r\nthat if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be\r\nunable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But\r\nin Princess Drubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal,\r\nsomething like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was\r\nquite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in\r\nhis career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of\r\nthose women—mostly mothers—who, having once made up their minds,\r\nwill not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if\r\nnecessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even\r\nto make scenes. This last consideration moved him.\r\n\r\n“My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and\r\nweariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you\r\nask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s\r\nmemory, I will do the impossible—your son shall be transferred to the\r\nGuards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?”\r\n\r\n“My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your\r\nkindness!” He turned to go.\r\n\r\n“Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...”\r\nshe faltered. “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich\r\nKutúzov ... recommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at\r\nrest, and then...”\r\n\r\nPrince Vasíli smiled.\r\n\r\n“No, I won’t promise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered\r\nsince his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that\r\nall the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as\r\nadjutants.”\r\n\r\n“No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...”\r\n\r\n“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,\r\n“we shall be late.”\r\n\r\n“Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?”\r\n\r\n“Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.”\r\n\r\n“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he\r\nwent, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably\r\ncame naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\r\n\r\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed\r\nall the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face\r\nresumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the\r\ngroup where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to\r\nlisten, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at\r\nMilan?” asked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of\r\nGenoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and\r\nMonsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of\r\nthe nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as\r\nif the whole world had gone crazy.”\r\n\r\nPrince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a\r\nsarcastic smile.\r\n\r\n“‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say he was\r\nvery fine when he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in\r\nItalian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’\r\n\r\n     * God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!\r\n\r\n“I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run\r\nover,” Anna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to\r\nendure this man who is a menace to everything.”\r\n\r\n“The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite\r\nbut hopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis\r\nXVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became\r\nmore animated. “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their\r\nbetrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending\r\nambassadors to compliment the usurper.”\r\n\r\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\r\n\r\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time\r\nthrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the\r\nlittle princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé\r\ncoat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity\r\nas if she had asked him to do it.\r\n\r\n“Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,”\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nThe princess listened, smiling.\r\n\r\n“If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the\r\nvicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which\r\nhe is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but\r\nfollows the current of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too\r\nfar. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society—I\r\nmean good French society—will have been forever destroyed, and\r\nthen....”\r\n\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to\r\nmake a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna,\r\nwho had him under observation, interrupted:\r\n\r\n“The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which\r\nalways accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has\r\ndeclared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose\r\ntheir own form of government; and I believe that once free from the\r\nusurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms\r\nof its rightful king,” she concluded, trying to be amiable to the\r\nroyalist emigrant.\r\n\r\n“That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le Vicomte quite\r\nrightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will\r\nbe difficult to return to the old regime.”\r\n\r\n“From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into\r\nthe conversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\r\nBonaparte’s side.”\r\n\r\n“It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without\r\nlooking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the\r\nreal state of French public opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his\r\nremarks at him, though without looking at him.\r\n\r\n“‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow\r\nit,’” Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting\r\nNapoleon’s words. “‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded\r\nin.’ I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.”\r\n\r\n“Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the\r\nduc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some\r\npeople,” he went on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero,\r\nafter the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one\r\nhero less on earth.”\r\n\r\nBefore Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their\r\nappreciation of the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the\r\nconversation, and though Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something\r\ninappropriate, she was unable to stop him.\r\n\r\n“The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre,\r\n“was a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon\r\nshowed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole\r\nresponsibility of that deed.”\r\n\r\n“Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.\r\n\r\n“What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows\r\ngreatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her\r\nwork nearer to her.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.\r\n\r\n“Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his\r\nknee with the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his\r\naudience over his spectacles and continued.\r\n\r\n“I say so,” he continued desperately, “because "

In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,\r\nand discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\r\n\r\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary\r\nstates, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than\r\nnew ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of\r\nhis ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise,\r\nfor a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless\r\nhe be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if\r\nhe should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to\r\nthe usurper, he will regain it.\r\n\r\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have\r\nwithstood the attacks of the Venetians in ’84, nor those of Pope Julius\r\nin ’10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the\r\nhereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it\r\nhappens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices\r\ncause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects\r\nwill be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and\r\nduration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are\r\nlost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nCONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\r\nnot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\r\ncollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\r\nan inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\r\nmen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and\r\nthis hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein\r\nthey are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\r\ngone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\r\nnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\r\nsubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\r\nwhich he must put upon his new acquisition.\r\n\r\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\r\nseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\r\nwho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\r\nway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\r\nfeeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\r\nforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\r\nof the natives.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\r\nMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\r\nonly needed Lodovico’s own forces; because those who had opened the\r\ngates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\r\nbenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\r\nvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\r\nthey are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\r\nlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\r\ndelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in\r\nthe weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time\r\nit was enough for the Duke Lodovico[1] to raise insurrections on the\r\nborders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to\r\nbring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be\r\ndefeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n [1] Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco Sforza, who\r\n married Beatrice d’Este. He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500, and\r\n died in 1510.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\r\ntime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\r\nto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and\r\nwhat any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself\r\nmore securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\r\n\r\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\r\nancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\r\nand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold\r\nthem, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government;\r\nand to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of\r\nthe prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in\r\nother things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will\r\nlive quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony,\r\nand Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\r\nalthough there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\r\ncustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\r\nthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has\r\nonly to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of\r\ntheir former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws\r\nnor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will\r\nbecome entirely one body with the old principality.\r\n\r\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\r\ncustoms, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\r\nenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\r\nhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside\r\nthere. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has\r\nmade that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other\r\nmeasures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled\r\nthere, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the\r\nspot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy\r\nthem; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are\r\ngreat, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the\r\ncountry is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied\r\nby prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have\r\nmore cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He\r\nwho would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost\r\ncaution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested\r\nfrom him with the greatest difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\r\nwhich may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\r\nthis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\r\nprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense\r\nhe can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority\r\nonly of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them\r\nto the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and\r\nscattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being\r\nuninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not\r\nto err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have\r\nbeen despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not\r\ncostly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as\r\nhas been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one\r\nhas to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed,\r\nbecause they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious\r\nones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man\r\nought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\r\n\r\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\r\nmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state,\r\nso that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\r\nexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\r\nof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\r\nall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\r\nown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\r\nguards are as useless as a colony is useful.\r\n\r\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\r\nought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\r\nneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\r\nthat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a\r\nfooting there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\r\nintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\r\nambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\r\nbrought into Greece by the Ætolians; and in every other country where\r\nthey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And\r\nthe usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner\r\nenters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the\r\nhatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to\r\nthose subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over\r\nto himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he\r\nhas acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold\r\nof too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces,\r\nand with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of\r\nthem, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does\r\nnot properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired,\r\nand whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\r\nmeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2]\r\nthe minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\r\ngreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\r\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\r\nÆtolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\r\nhumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\r\nÆtolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\r\ndid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\r\nwithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make\r\nthem agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because\r\nthe Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\r\nwho have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\r\nwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it\r\nis easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the\r\nmedicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable;\r\nfor it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic\r\nfever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but\r\ndifficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either\r\ndetected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but\r\ndifficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the\r\nevils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise\r\nman to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not\r\nhaving been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that\r\nevery one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the\r\nRomans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to\r\navoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war\r\nis not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of\r\nothers; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in\r\nGreece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided\r\nboth, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which\r\nis forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the\r\nbenefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and\r\nprudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring\r\nwith it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\r\n\r\n [2] See remark in the introduction on the word “intrattenere.”\r\n\r\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\r\nthings mentioned. I will speak of Louis[3] (and not of Charles)[4] as\r\nthe one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\r\npossession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\r\nhas done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain\r\na state composed of divers elements.\r\n\r\n [3] Louis XII, King of France, “The Father of the People,” born 1462,\r\n died 1515.\r\n\r\n [4] Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\r\n\r\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\r\ndesired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\r\nwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\r\nfoothold in Italy, and having no friends there—seeing rather that every\r\ndoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles—he was forced to\r\naccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have\r\nsucceeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not\r\nmade some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy,\r\nregained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded;\r\nthe Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of\r\nFerrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of\r\nPesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans,\r\nthe Sienese—everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then\r\ncould the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them,\r\nwhich, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made\r\nthe king master of two-thirds of Italy.\r\n\r\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could\r\nhave maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above\r\nlaid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although\r\nthey were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the\r\nChurch, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been\r\nforced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have\r\nmade himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no\r\nsooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to\r\noccupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was\r\nweakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had\r\nthrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by\r\nadding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater\r\nauthority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to\r\nfollow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of\r\nAlexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was\r\nhimself forced to come into Italy.\r\n\r\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\r\ndeprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\r\ndivided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter\r\nin Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country\r\nand the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and\r\nwhereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he\r\ndrove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out\r\nin turn.\r\n\r\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\r\ndo so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\r\nwhen they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\r\nfolly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\r\nher own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\r\nought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\r\nthe Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she\r\ngot a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had\r\nnot the excuse of that necessity.\r\n\r\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\r\nhe increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\r\nbrought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did\r\nnot send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to\r\ninjure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from\r\nthe Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought\r\nSpain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to\r\nhumble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\r\nconsented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\r\nkept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\r\nnever have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\r\nbecause the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\r\nto give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\r\nhave had the courage.\r\n\r\nAnd if any one should say: “King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\r\nand the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,” I answer for the reasons given\r\nabove that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war,\r\nbecause it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your\r\ndisadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king\r\nhad given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in\r\nexchange for the dissolution of his marriage[5] and for the cap to\r\nRouen,[6] to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the\r\nfaith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\r\n\r\n [5] Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI, and\r\n married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to\r\n retain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown.\r\n\r\n [6] The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d’Amboise, created a\r\n cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\r\n\r\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\r\nconditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\r\nwished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\r\nis reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\r\nwith Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope\r\nAlexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal\r\nRouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I\r\nreplied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning\r\nthat otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\r\ngreatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the\r\nChurch and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin\r\nmay be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which\r\nnever or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming\r\npowerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about\r\neither by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him\r\nwho has been raised to power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nWHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL\r\nAGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly\r\nacquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great\r\nbecame the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was\r\nscarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole\r\nempire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained\r\nthemselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose\r\namong themselves from their own ambitions.\r\n\r\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to\r\nbe governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of\r\nservants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his\r\nfavour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity\r\nby antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons\r\nhave states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and\r\nhold th"

		    "text": "The Great Gatsby\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIn my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\r\nthat I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\r\n\r\n“Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just\r\nremember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages\r\nthat you’ve had.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative\r\nin a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\r\nthan that. In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\r\nhabit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\r\nthe victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\r\ndetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\r\nperson, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\r\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\r\nunknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\r\nfeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\r\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\r\nthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\r\nthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\r\nmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\r\ninfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\r\nforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\r\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\r\nunequally at birth.\r\n\r\nAnd, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\r\nthat it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\r\nwet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded\r\non. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\r\nthe world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\r\nwanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\r\nhuman heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\r\nexempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\r\nhave an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\r\nsuccessful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\r\nheightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\r\nto one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\r\nthousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\r\nflabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\r\n“creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\r\nromantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\r\nwhich it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\r\nall right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\r\nfloated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\r\ninterest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle\r\nWestern city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a\r\nclan, and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of\r\nBuccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s\r\nbrother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\r\nWar, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\r\ncarries on today.\r\n\r\nI never saw this great-uncle, but I’m supposed to look like him—with\r\nspecial reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\r\nfather’s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of\r\na century after my father, and a little later I participated in that\r\ndelayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\r\ncounter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\r\nthe warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the\r\nragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond\r\nbusiness. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it\r\ncould support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\r\nover as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,\r\n“Why—ye-es,” with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\r\nme for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I\r\nthought, in the spring of twenty-two.\r\n\r\nThe practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm\r\nseason, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly\r\ntrees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a\r\nhouse together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He\r\nfound the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a\r\nmonth, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and\r\nI went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a\r\nfew days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who\r\nmade my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to\r\nherself over the electric stove.\r\n\r\nIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more\r\nrecently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.\r\n\r\n“How do you get to West Egg village?” he asked helplessly.\r\n\r\nI told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,\r\na pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\r\nfreedom of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\r\ntrees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar\r\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\r\n\r\nThere was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to\r\nbe pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\r\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they\r\nstood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,\r\npromising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and\r\nMaecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other\r\nbooks besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a\r\nseries of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\r\nI was going to bring back all such things into my life and become\r\nagain that most limited of all specialists, the “well-rounded man.”\r\nThis isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at\r\nfrom a single window, after all.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\r\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\r\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where\r\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\r\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\r\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\r\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great\r\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the\r\negg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact\r\nend—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\r\nwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\r\ninteresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular\r\nexcept shape and size.\r\n\r\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though\r\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\r\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\r\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\r\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\r\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual\r\nimitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one\r\nside, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble\r\nswimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was\r\nGatsby’s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a\r\nmansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an\r\neyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I\r\nhad a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and\r\nthe consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAcross the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\r\nglittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\r\non the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\r\nBuchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I’d known Tom\r\nin college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nHer husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\r\nthe most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a\r\nnational figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\r\nlimited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of\r\nanticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his\r\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago\r\nand come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\r\ninstance, he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\r\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\r\nwealthy enough to do that.\r\n\r\nWhy they came East I don’t know. They had spent a year in France for\r\nno particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully\r\nwherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a\r\npermanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe\r\nit—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift\r\non forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of\r\nsome irrecoverable football game.\r\n\r\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\r\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house\r\nwas even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white\r\nGeorgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at\r\nthe beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\r\njumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\r\nit reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\r\nfrom the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French\r\nwindows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm\r\nwindy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with\r\nhis legs apart on the front porch.\r\n\r\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy\r\nstraw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\r\nsupercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\r\ndominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\r\naggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\r\nclothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\r\nthose glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\r\nsee a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\r\nthin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\r\n\r\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\r\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\r\nit, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who\r\nhad hated his guts.\r\n\r\n“Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,” he seemed to\r\nsay, “just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.” We\r\nwere in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I\r\nalways had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\r\nhim with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\r\n\r\nWe talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got a nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about\r\nrestlessly.\r\n\r\nTurning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the\r\nfront vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\r\nacre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped\r\nthe tide offshore.\r\n\r\n“It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.” He turned me around again,\r\npolitely and abruptly. “We’ll go inside.”\r\n\r\nWe walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,\r\nfragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The\r\nwindows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\r\nthat seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\r\nthe room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\r\nflags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\r\nceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\r\non it as wind does on the sea.\r\n\r\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\r\ncouch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\r\nanchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\r\nrippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\r\nshort flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\r\nlistening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\r\npicture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\r\nrear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\r\ncurtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\r\nlength at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\r\nchin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\r\nwas quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\r\nshe gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\r\nan apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\r\n\r\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\r\nforward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\r\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“I’m p-paralysed with happiness.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\r\nhand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\r\nno one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\r\nhad. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\r\nBaker. (I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people\r\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\r\ncharming.)\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\r\nimperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object\r\nshe was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\r\nsomething of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\r\nAlmost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned\r\ntribute from me.\r\n\r\nI looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,\r\nthrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\r\ndown, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\r\nplayed again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\r\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\r\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\r\na singing compulsion, a whispered “Listen,” a promise that she had\r\ndone gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\r\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\r\n\r\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\r\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\r\n\r\n“Do they miss me?” she cried ecstatically.\r\n\r\n“The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\r\npainted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all\r\nnight along the north shore.”\r\n\r\n“How gorgeous! Let’s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!” Then she added\r\nirrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to.”\r\n\r\n“She’s asleep. She’s three years old. Haven’t you ever seen her?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you ought to see her. She’s—”\r\n\r\nTom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped\r\nand rested his hand on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“What you doing, Nick?”\r\n\r\n“I’m a bond man.”\r\n\r\n“Who with?”\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n“Never heard of them,” he remarked decisively.\r\n\r\nThis annoyed me.\r\n\r\n“You will,” I answered shortly. “You will if you stay in the East.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at\r\nDaisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something\r\nmore. “I’d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.”\r\n\r\nAt this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that\r\nI started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the\r\nroom. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\r\nand with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\r\n\r\n“I’m stiff,” she complained, “I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long\r\nas I can remember.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t look at me,” Daisy retorted, “I’ve been trying to get you to\r\nNew York all afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“No, thanks,” said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\r\npantry. “I’m absolutely in training.”\r\n\r\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\r\n\r\n“You are!” He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\r\nof a glass. “How you ever get anything done is beyond me.”\r\n\r\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she “got done.” I\r\nenjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\r\nan erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\r\nat the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\r\nback at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\r\ndiscontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\r\npicture of her, somewhere before.\r\n\r\n“You live in West Egg,” she remarked contemptuously. “I know somebody\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know a single—”\r\n\r\n“You must know Gatsby.”\r\n\r\n“Gatsby?” demanded Daisy. “What Gatsby?”\r\n\r\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\r\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\r\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\r\n\r\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\r\nyoung women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\r\nthe sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\r\ndiminished wind.\r\n\r\n“Why candles?” objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\r\nfingers. “In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.” She\r\nlooked at us all radiantly. “Do you always watch for the longest day\r\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\r\nthe year and then miss it.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to plan something,” yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\r\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Daisy. “What’ll we plan?” She turned to me\r\nhelplessly: “What do people plan?”\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\r\nlittle finger.\r\n\r\n“Look!” she complained; “I hurt it.”\r\n\r\nWe all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\r\n\r\n“You did it, Tom,” she said accusingly. “I know you didn’t mean to,\r\nbut you did do it. That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a\r\ngreat, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”\r\n\r\n“I hate that word ‘hulking,’ ” objected Tom crossly, “even in\r\nkidding.”\r\n\r\n“Hulking,” insisted Daisy.\r\n\r\nSometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\r\nbantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\r\nas their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\r\ndesire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\r\npolite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\r\nthat presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\r\nwould be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\r\nWest, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its\r\nclose, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\r\nnervous dread of the moment itself.\r\n\r\n“You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,” I confessed on my second glass\r\nof corky but rather impressive claret. “Can’t you talk about crops or\r\nsomething?”\r\n\r\nI meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in\r\nan unexpected way.\r\n\r\n“Civilization’s going to pieces,” broke out Tom violently. “I’ve\r\ngotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise\r\nof the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no,” I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is\r\nif we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly\r\nsubmerged. It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.”\r\n\r\n“Tom’s getting very profound,” said Daisy, with an expression of\r\nunthoughtful sadness. “He reads deep books with long words in\r\nthem. What was that word we—”\r\n\r\n“Well, these books are all scientific,” insisted Tom, glancing at her\r\nimpatiently. “This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It’s up to\r\nus, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will\r\nhave control of things.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve got to beat them down,” whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\r\ntoward the fervent sun.\r\n\r\n“You ought to live in California—” began Miss Baker, but Tom\r\ninterrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\r\n\r\n“This idea is that we’re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,\r\nand—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\r\nslight nod, and she winked at me again. “—And we’ve produced all the\r\nthings that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all\r\nthat. Do you see?”\r\n\r\nThere was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his\r\ncomplacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.\r\nWhen, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler\r\nleft the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you a family secret,” she whispered enthusiastically.\r\n“It’s about the butler’s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler’s\r\nnose?”\r\n\r\n“That’s why I came over tonight.”\r\n\r\n“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher\r\nfor some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred\r\npeople. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it\r\nbegan to affect his nose—”\r\n\r\n“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up\r\nhis position.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her\r\nglowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I\r\nlistened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering\r\nregret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\r\n\r\nThe butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear,\r\nwhereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went\r\ninside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned\r\nforward again, her voice glowing and singing.\r\n\r\n“I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an\r\nabsolute rose. Doesn’t he?” She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:\r\n“An absolute rose?”\r\n\r\nThis was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\r\nextemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart\r\nwas trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,\r\nthrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and\r\nexcused herself and went into the house.\r\n\r\nMiss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\r\nmeaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said “Sh!”\r\nin a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the\r\nroom beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to\r\nhear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\r\nmounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\r\n\r\n“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began.\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk. I want to hear what happens.”\r\n\r\n“Is something happening?” I inquired innocently.\r\n\r\n“You mean to say you don’t know?” said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\r\n“I thought everybody knew.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why—” she said hesitantly. “Tom’s got some woman in New York.”\r\n\r\n“Got some woman?” I repeated blankly.\r\n\r\nMiss Baker nodded.\r\n\r\n“She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.\r\nDon’t you think?”\r\n\r\nAlmost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a\r\ndress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“It couldn’t be helped!” cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\r\n\r\nShe sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and\r\ncontinued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic\r\noutdoors. There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\r\nnightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He’s singing\r\naway—” Her voice sang: “It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?”\r\n\r\n“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light\r\nenough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head\r\ndecisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,\r\nvanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes\r\nat table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I\r\nwas conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to\r\navoid all eyes. I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but\r\nI doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain\r\nhardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill\r\nmetallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation\r\nmight have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone\r\nimmediately for the police.\r\n\r\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\r\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into\r\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\r\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed\r\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\r\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\r\n\r\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and\r\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that\r\nturbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\r\nsome sedative questions about her little girl.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know each other very well, Nick,” she said suddenly. “Even\r\nif we are cousins. You didn’t come to my wedding.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t back from the war.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true.” She hesitated. “Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick,\r\nand I’m pretty cynical about everything.”\r\n\r\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn’t say any more,\r\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n“I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes.” She looked at me absently. “Listen, Nick; let me tell you\r\nwhat I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?”\r\n\r\n“Very much.”\r\n\r\n“It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was\r\nless than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of\r\nthe ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right\r\naway if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I\r\nturned my head away and wept. ‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a\r\ngirl. And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be\r\nin this world, a beautiful little fool.’\r\n\r\n“You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,” she went on in a\r\nconvinced way. “Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I\r\nknow. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.”\r\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and\r\nshe laughed with thrilling scorn. “Sophisticated—God, I’m\r\nsophisticated!”\r\n\r\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my\r\nbelief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me\r\nuneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\r\nexact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a\r\nmoment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as\r\nif she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret\r\nsociety to which she and Tom belonged.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at\r\neither end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the\r\nSaturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running\r\ntogether in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and\r\ndull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as\r\nshe turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\r\n\r\nWhen we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\r\n\r\n“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in\r\nour very next issue.”\r\n\r\nHer body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\r\nstood up.\r\n\r\n“Ten o’clock,” she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\r\nceiling. “Time for this good girl to go to bed.”\r\n\r\n“Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,” explained Daisy,\r\n“over at Westchester.”\r\n\r\n“Oh—you’re Jordan Baker.”\r\n\r\nI knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous\r\nexpression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the\r\nsporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard\r\nsome story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I\r\nhad forgotten long ago.\r\n\r\n“Good night,” she said softly. “Wake me at eight, won’t you.”\r\n\r\n“If you’ll get up.”\r\n\r\n“I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.”\r\n\r\n“Of course you will,” confirmed Daisy. “In fact I think I’ll arrange a\r\nmarriage. Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you\r\ntogether. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\r\nyou out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”\r\n\r\n“Good night,” called Miss Baker from the stairs. “I haven’t heard a\r\nword.”\r\n\r\n“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment. “They oughtn’t to let\r\nher run around the country this way.”\r\n\r\n“Who oughtn’t to?” inquired Daisy coldly.\r\n\r\n“Her family.”\r\n\r\n“Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick’s\r\ngoing to look after her, aren’t you, Nick? She’s going to spend lots\r\nof weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be\r\nvery good for her.”\r\n\r\nDaisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\r\n\r\n“Is she from New York?” I asked quickly.\r\n\r\n“From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\r\nbeautiful white—”\r\n\r\n“Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?”\r\ndemanded Tom suddenly.\r\n\r\n“Did I?” She looked at me. “I can’t seem to remember, but I think we\r\ntalked about the Nordic race. Yes, I’m sure we did. It sort of crept\r\nup on us and first thing you know—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,” he advised me.\r\n\r\nI said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes\r\nlater I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood\r\nside by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor\r\nDaisy peremptorily called: “Wait!”\r\n\r\n“I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important. We heard you were\r\nengaged to a girl out West.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” corroborated Tom kindly. “We heard that you were\r\nengaged.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a libel. I’m too poor.”\r\n\r\n“But we heard it,” insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again\r\nin a flower-like way. “We heard it from three people, so it must be\r\ntrue.”\r\n\r\nOf course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even\r\nvaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one\r\nof the reasons I had come East. You can’t stop going with an old\r\nfriend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention\r\nof being rumoured into marriage.\r\n\r\nTheir interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\r\nrich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\r\naway. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out\r\nof the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such\r\nintentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman\r\nin New York” was really less surprising than that he had been\r\ndepressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of\r\nstale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his\r\nperemptory heart.\r\n\r\nAlready it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\r\ngarages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and\r\nwhen I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and\r\nsat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had\r\nblown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the\r\ntrees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth\r\nblew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered\r\nacross the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I\r\nwas not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of\r\nmy neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\r\nregarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\r\nmovements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\r\nthat it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\r\nhis of our local heavens.\r\n\r\nI decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\r\nthat would do for an introduction. But I didn’t call to him, for he\r\ngave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched\r\nout his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was\r\nfrom him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced\r\nseaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute\r\nand far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked\r\nonce more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the\r\nunquiet darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nAbout halfway between West Egg and New York the motor road hastily\r\njoins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as\r\nto shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley\r\nof ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and\r\nhills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and\r\nchimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of\r\nash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery\r\nair. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track,\r\ngives out a ghastly creak, and comes to rest, and immediately the\r\nash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable\r\ncloud, which screens their obscure operations from your sight.\r\n\r\nBut above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift\r\nendlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T.\r\nJ. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and\r\ngigantic—their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face,\r\nbut, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass\r\nover a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set\r\nthem there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then\r\nsank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved\r\naway. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun\r\nand rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.\r\n\r\nThe valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and,\r\nwhen the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on\r\nwaiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an\r\nhour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was\r\nbecause of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.\r\n\r\nThe fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His\r\nacquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés\r\nwith her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with\r\nwhomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire\r\nto meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one\r\nafternoon, and when we stopped by the ash-heaps he jumped to his feet\r\nand, taking hold of my elbow, literally forced me from the car.\r\n\r\n“We’re getting off,” he insisted. “I want you to meet my girl.”\r\n\r\nI think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon, and his determination\r\nto have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption\r\nwas that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.\r\n\r\nI followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked\r\nback a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s\r\npersistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of\r\nyellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact\r\nMain Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing.\r\nOne of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an\r\nall-night restaurant, approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\r\ngarage—Repairs. George B. Wilson. Cars bought and sold.—and I followed\r\nTom inside.\r\n\r\nThe interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the\r\ndust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had\r\noccurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind, and that\r\nsumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead, when the\r\nproprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands\r\non a piece of waste. He was a blond, spiritless man, anaemic, and\r\nfaintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his\r\nlight blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Wilson, old man,” said Tom, slapping him jovially on the\r\nshoulder. “How’s business?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t complain,” answered Wilson unconvincingly. “When are you\r\ngoing to sell me that car?”\r\n\r\n“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”\r\n\r\n“Works pretty slow, don’t he?”\r\n\r\n“No, he doesn’t,” said Tom coldly. “And if you feel that way about it,\r\nmaybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean that,” explained Wilson quickly. “I just meant—”\r\n\r\nHis voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.\r\nThen I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish\r\nfigure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was\r\nin the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh\r\nsensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark\r\nblue crêpe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty, but there\r\nwas an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of\r\nher body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and, walking\r\nthrough her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom,\r\nlooking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips, and without\r\nturning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\r\n\r\n“Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little\r\noffice, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls. A\r\nwhite ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled\r\neverything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.\r\n\r\n“I want to see you,” said Tom intently. “Get on the next train.”\r\n\r\n“All right.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll meet you by the newsstand on the lower level.”\r\n\r\nShe nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with\r\ntwo chairs from his office door.\r\n\r\nWe waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days\r\nbefore the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was\r\nsetting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.\r\n\r\n“Terrible place, isn’t it,” said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor\r\nEckleburg.\r\n\r\n“Awful.”\r\n\r\n“It does her good to get away.”\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t her husband object?”\r\n\r\n“Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He’s so\r\ndumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.”\r\n\r\nSo Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not\r\nquite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom\r\ndeferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might\r\nbe on the train.\r\n\r\nShe had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin, which stretched\r\ntight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in\r\nNew York. At the newsstand she bought a copy of Town Tattle and a\r\nmoving-picture magazine, and in the station drugstore some cold cream\r\nand a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive\r\nshe let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one,\r\nlavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from\r\nthe mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she\r\nturned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the\r\nfront glass.\r\n\r\n“I want to get one of those dogs,” she said earnestly. “I want to get\r\none for the apartment. They’re nice to have—a dog.”\r\n\r\nWe backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John\r\nD. Rockefeller. In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very\r\nrecent puppies of an indeterminate breed.\r\n\r\n“What kind are they?” asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly, as he came to the\r\ntaxi-window.\r\n\r\n“All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got\r\nthat kind?”\r\n\r\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and\r\ndrew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\r\n\r\n“That’s no police dog,” said Tom.\r\n\r\n“No, it’s not exactly a police dog,” said the man with disappointment\r\nin his voice. “It’s more of an Airedale.” He passed his hand over the\r\nbrown washrag of a back. “Look at that coat. Some coat. That’s a dog\r\nthat’ll never bother you with catching cold.”\r\n\r\n“I think it’s cute,” said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. “How much is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“That dog?” He looked at it admiringly. “That dog will cost you ten\r\ndollars.”\r\n\r\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it\r\nsomewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and\r\nsettled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the\r\nweatherproof coat with rapture.\r\n\r\n“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked delicately.\r\n\r\n“That dog? That dog’s a boy.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a bitch,” said Tom decisively. “Here’s your money. Go and buy\r\nten more dogs with it.”\r\n\r\nWe drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the\r\nsummer Sunday afternoon. I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great\r\nflock of white sheep turn the corner.\r\n\r\n“Hold on,” I said, “I have to leave you here.”\r\n\r\n“No you don’t,” interposed Tom quickly. “Myrtle’ll be hurt if you\r\ndon’t come up to the apartment. Won’t you, Myrtle?”\r\n\r\n“Come on,” she urged. “I’ll telephone my sister Catherine. She’s said\r\nto be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’d like to, but—”\r\n\r\nWe went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.\r\nAt 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of\r\napartment-houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the\r\nneighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other\r\npurchases, and went haughtily in.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to have the McKees come up,” she announced as we rose in\r\nthe elevator. “And, of course, I got to call up my sister, too.”\r\n\r\nThe apartment was on the top floor—a small living-room, a small\r\ndining-room, a small bedroom, and a bath. The living-room was crowded\r\nto the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for\r\nit, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of\r\nladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an\r\nover-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.\r\nLooked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a\r\nbonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the\r\nroom. Several old copies of Town Tattle lay on the table together with\r\na copy of Simon Called Peter, and some of the small scandal magazines\r\nof Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant\r\nelevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk, to which he\r\nadded on his own initiative a tin of large, hard dog biscuits—one of\r\nwhich decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all\r\nafternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whisky from a locked\r\nbureau door.\r\n\r\nI have been drunk just twice in my life, and the second time was that\r\nafternoon; so everything that happened has a dim, hazy cast over it,\r\nalthough until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful\r\nsun. Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the\r\ntelephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some\r\nat the drugstore on the corner. When I came back they had both\r\ndisappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a\r\nchapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the\r\nwhisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me.\r\n\r\nJust as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called\r\neach other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive\r\nat the apartment door.\r\n\r\nThe sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty,\r\nwith a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky\r\nwhite. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\r\nrakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\r\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\r\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\r\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\r\nhaste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I\r\nwondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed\r\nimmoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a\r\ngirl friend at a hotel.\r\n\r\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just\r\nshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he\r\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\r\ninformed me that he was in the “artistic game,” and I gathered later\r\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of\r\nMrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His\r\nwife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with\r\npride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven\r\ntimes since they had been married.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now\r\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,\r\nwhich gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With\r\nthe influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\r\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\r\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\r\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she\r\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\r\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she told her sister in a high, mincing shout, “most of\r\nthese fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I\r\nhad a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me\r\nthe bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”\r\n\r\n“What was the name of the woman?” asked Mrs. McKee.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own\r\nhomes.”\r\n\r\n“I like your dress,” remarked Mrs. McKee, “I think it’s adorable.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\r\n\r\n“It’s just a crazy old thing,” she said. “I just slip it on sometimes\r\nwhen I don’t care what I look like.”\r\n\r\n“But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,” pursued Mrs.\r\nMcKee. “If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could\r\nmake something of it.”\r\n\r\nWe all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair\r\nfrom over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr.\r\nMcKee regarded her intently with his head on one side, and then moved\r\nhis hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.\r\n\r\n“I should change the light,” he said after a moment. “I’d like to\r\nbring out the modelling of the features. And I’d try to get hold of\r\nall the back hair.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t think of changing the light,” cried Mrs. McKee. “I think\r\nit’s—”\r\n\r\nHer husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again,\r\nwhereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.\r\n\r\n“You McKees have something to drink,” he said. “Get some more ice and\r\nmineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“I told that boy about the ice.” Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair\r\nat the shiftlessness of the lower orders. “These people! You have to\r\nkeep after them all the time.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to\r\nthe dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and"

Marseilles—The Arrival\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\r\nsignalled the three-master, the _Pharaon_ from Smyrna, Trieste, and\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,\r\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\r\n\r\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\r\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\r\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the _Pharaon_,\r\nhas been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs\r\nto an owner of the city.\r\n\r\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\r\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\r\nPomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker,\r\nbut so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is\r\nthe forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\r\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\r\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\r\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\r\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\r\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the _Pharaon_ towards the\r\nnarrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity\r\nand vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\r\ndirection of the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\r\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\r\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\r\nalongside the _Pharaon_, which he reached as she rounded into La\r\nRéserve basin.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\r\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s\r\nbulwarks.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\r\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole\r\nappearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men\r\naccustomed from their cradle to contend with danger.\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the\r\nmatter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?”\r\n\r\n“A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man, “a great\r\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\r\nCaptain Leclere.”\r\n\r\n“And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that\r\nhead. But poor Captain Leclere——”\r\n\r\n“What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable\r\nresignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?”\r\n\r\n“He died.”\r\n\r\n“Fell into the sea?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to\r\nthe crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!”\r\n\r\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the\r\ncrew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and\r\nouthaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail\r\nclewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his\r\norders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to\r\nthe owner.\r\n\r\n“And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the\r\ninterrupted conversation.\r\n\r\n0023m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the\r\nharbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.\r\nIn twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days\r\nafterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his\r\nrest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head\r\nand his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword\r\nand cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man\r\nwith a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten\r\nyears, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted\r\nat every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the\r\nyoung. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure\r\nme that the cargo——”\r\n\r\n“Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise\r\nyou not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.”\r\n\r\nThen, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:\r\n“Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!”\r\n\r\nThe order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a\r\nman-of-war.\r\n\r\n“Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered,\r\nand the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.\r\n\r\n“Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the\r\nowner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out\r\nof his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I\r\nmust look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.”\r\n\r\nThe owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which\r\nDantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit\r\nto a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man,\r\ngoing to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came\r\ntowards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of\r\nage, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors,\r\ninsolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as\r\nresponsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors,\r\nmade him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune\r\nthat has befallen us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.”\r\n\r\n“And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,\r\nas became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as\r\nthat of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars.\r\n\r\n“But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the\r\nanchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so\r\nold as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend\r\nEdmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require\r\ninstruction from anyone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate.\r\n“Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was\r\nthe captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command\r\nwithout consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at\r\nthe Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.”\r\n\r\n0025m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his\r\nduty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of\r\nElba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.”\r\n\r\n“The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are,\r\nM. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the\r\npleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.”\r\n\r\n“Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this\r\nway!”\r\n\r\n“In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling\r\nto the crew, he said, “Let go!”\r\n\r\nThe anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through\r\nthe port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of\r\nthe pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added,\r\n“Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!”\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my\r\nword.”\r\n\r\n“And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner.\r\n\r\n“Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.”\r\n\r\n“And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is\r\ntrue, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.”\r\n\r\nA cloud passed over Danglars’ brow.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now\r\nrides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?”\r\n\r\nDanglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped\r\nat the Island of Elba?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain\r\nLeclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.”\r\n\r\n“Then did you see him, Edmond?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“The marshal.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMorrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said\r\nsuddenly—\r\n\r\n“And how is the emperor?”\r\n\r\n“Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.”\r\n\r\n“You saw the emperor, then?”\r\n\r\n“He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.”\r\n\r\n“And you spoke to him?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“And what did he say to you?”\r\n\r\n“Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the\r\ncourse she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not\r\nbeen laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I\r\ntold him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &\r\nSon. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners\r\nfrom father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same\r\nregiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And\r\nthat was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain.\r\nDantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you\r\nwill see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,”\r\ncontinued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right,\r\nDantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba,\r\nalthough if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the\r\nmarshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into\r\ntrouble.”\r\n\r\n0027m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did\r\nnot even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made\r\nsuch inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are\r\nthe health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And\r\nthe young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached,\r\nand said,—\r\n\r\n“Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his\r\nlanding at Porto-Ferrajo?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.”\r\n\r\n“Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not\r\npleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.”\r\n\r\n“Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much.\r\nIt was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.”\r\n\r\n“Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“To me?—no—was there one?”\r\n\r\n“I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter\r\nto his care.”\r\n\r\n“Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?”\r\n\r\nDanglars turned very red.\r\n\r\n“I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half\r\nopen, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.”\r\n\r\n“He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be\r\nany letter he will give it to me.”\r\n\r\nDanglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said\r\nhe, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been\r\nmistaken.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You have not been long detained.”\r\n\r\n“No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and\r\nas to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I\r\ngave them.”\r\n\r\n“Then you have nothing more to do here?”\r\n\r\n“No—everything is all right now.”\r\n\r\n“Then you can come and dine with me?”\r\n\r\n“I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due\r\nto my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have\r\ndone me.”\r\n\r\n0029m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.”\r\n\r\n“And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my\r\nfather is?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.”\r\n\r\n“That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your\r\nabsence.”\r\n\r\nDantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left,\r\nI doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from\r\nHeaven.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has\r\nbeen paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.”\r\n\r\n“True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who\r\nexpects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.”\r\n\r\nDantès blushed.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she\r\nhas been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the\r\n_Pharaon_. _Peste!_ Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!”\r\n\r\n“She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my\r\nbetrothed.”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain\r\nyou. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all\r\nthe time you require for your own. Do you want any money?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.”\r\n\r\n“You are a careful fellow, Edmond.”\r\n\r\n“Say I have a poor father, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see\r\nyour father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those\r\nwho detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have your leave, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?”\r\n\r\n“He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your\r\nleave of absence for some days.”\r\n\r\n“To get married?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six\r\nweeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until\r\nthree months after that; only be back again in three months, for the\r\n_Pharaon_,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back,\r\n“cannot sail without her captain.”\r\n\r\n“Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation;\r\n“pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes\r\nof my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the\r\n_Pharaon_?”\r\n\r\n“If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and\r\ncall it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian\r\nproverb—_Chi ha compagno ha padrone_—‘He who has a partner has a\r\nmaster.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of\r\ntwo votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes,\r\nand grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of\r\nmy father and of Mercédès.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the\r\ndeserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I row you ashore?”\r\n\r\n“No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with\r\nDanglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?”\r\n\r\n“That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you\r\nmean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the\r\nday when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose\r\nto him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle\r\nthe dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite\r\nright to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the\r\nquestion, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you\r\nwill be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the _Pharaon_ should you be\r\nglad to see Danglars remain?”\r\n\r\n“Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect\r\nfor those who possess the owners’ confidence.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good\r\nfellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you\r\nare.”\r\n\r\n“Then I have leave?”\r\n\r\n“Go, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“May I have the use of your skiff?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!”\r\n\r\n“I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.”\r\n\r\nThe young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern\r\nsheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two\r\noarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly\r\nas possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the\r\nnarrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of\r\nthe harbor to the Quai d’Orléans.\r\n\r\nThe shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him\r\nspring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which\r\nfrom five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in\r\nthe famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern\r\nPhocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world,\r\nand with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If\r\nParis had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning\r\nround the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders,\r\nbut in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great\r\ndifference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the\r\nmovements of Edmond Dantès.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 2. Father and Son\r\n\r\nWe will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and\r\nendeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil\r\nsuspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantès, who, after having\r\ntraversed La Canebière, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small\r\nhouse, on the left of the Allées de Meilhan, rapidly ascended four\r\nflights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while\r\nwith the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused\r\nbefore a half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThis room was occupied by Dantès’ father. The news of the arrival of\r\nthe _Pharaon_ had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair,\r\nwas amusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and\r\nsprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.\r\nSuddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice\r\nbehind him exclaimed, “Father—dear father!”\r\n\r\nThe old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he\r\nfell into his arms, pale and trembling.\r\n\r\n“What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?” inquired the young\r\nman, much alarmed.\r\n\r\n“No, no, my dear Edmond—my boy—my son!—no; but I did not expect you;\r\nand joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly—Ah, I feel as if I were\r\ngoing to die.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! ’Tis I—really I! They say joy\r\nnever hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do\r\nsmile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and\r\nwe are going to be happy.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, my boy, so we will—so we will,” replied the old man; “but\r\nhow shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me\r\nall the good fortune that has befallen you.”\r\n\r\n“God forgive me,” said the young man, “for rejoicing at happiness\r\nderived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek\r\nthis good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to\r\nlament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable\r\nthat, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you\r\nunderstand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred\r\nlouis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor\r\nsailor like me could have hoped for?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear boy,” replied the old man, “it is very fortunate.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small\r\nhouse, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and\r\nhoneysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away”—and as he said so the\r\nold man’s strength failed him, and he fell backwards.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said the young man, “a glass of wine, father, will revive\r\nyou. Where do you keep your wine?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,” said the\r\nold man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,” and he opened two or three\r\ncupboards.\r\n\r\n“It is no use,” said the old man, “there is no wine.”\r\n\r\n“What, no wine?” said Dantès, turning pale, and looking alternately at\r\nthe hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. “What, no\r\nwine? Have you wanted money, father?”\r\n\r\n“I want nothing now that I have you,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Yet,” stammered Dantès, wiping the perspiration from his brow,—“yet I\r\ngave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little\r\ndebt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if I\r\ndid not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,\r\nlest he might do you an injury——”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I paid him.”\r\n\r\n“But,” cried Dantès, “it was a hundred and forty francs I owed\r\nCaderousse.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” stammered the old man.\r\n\r\n“And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?”\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded.\r\n\r\n“So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,” muttered\r\nEdmond.\r\n\r\n“You know how little I require,” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Heaven pardon me,” cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?”\r\n\r\n“You have wounded me to the heart.”\r\n\r\n“Never mind it, for I see you once more,” said the old man; “and now\r\nit’s all over—everything is all right again.”\r\n\r\n0035m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Yes, here I am,” said the young man, “with a promising future and a\r\nlittle money. Here, father, here!” he said, “take this—take it, and\r\nsend for something immediately.” And he emptied his pockets on the\r\ntable, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six\r\nfive-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dantès\r\nbrightened.\r\n\r\n“Whom does this belong to?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and\r\ntomorrow we shall have more.”\r\n\r\n“Gently, gently,” said the old man, with a smile; “and by your leave I\r\nwill use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy\r\ntoo many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your\r\nreturn, in order to be able to purchase them.”\r\n\r\n“Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I\r\nwill not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and\r\nmost capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall\r\nhave tomorrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.”\r\n\r\n“’Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to\r\ncongratulate you on your fortunate return.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,” murmured\r\nEdmond. “But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on\r\na time, so he’s welcome.”\r\n\r\nAs Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at\r\nthe door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of\r\ncloth, which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.\r\n\r\n“What, is it you, Edmond, back again?” said he, with a broad\r\nMarseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you\r\nin any and every way,” replied Dantès, but ill-concealing his coldness\r\nunder this cloak of civility.\r\n\r\n“Thanks—thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it\r\nchances that at times there are others who have need of me.” Dantès\r\nmade a gesture. “I do not allude to you, my boy. No!—no! I lent you\r\nmoney, and you returned it; that’s like good neighbors, and we are\r\nquits.”\r\n\r\n“We are never quits with those who oblige us,” was Dantès’ reply; “for\r\nwhen we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk\r\nof your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece\r\nof mulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. ‘You at\r\nMarseilles?’—‘Yes,’ says he.\r\n\r\n“‘I thought you were at Smyrna.’—‘I was; but am now back again.’\r\n\r\n“‘And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, with his father, no doubt,’ replied Danglars. And so I came,”\r\nadded Caderousse, “as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking\r\nhands with a friend.”\r\n\r\n0037m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Worthy Caderousse!” said the old man, “he is so much attached to us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are\r\nso rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,” continued the\r\ntailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantès\r\nhad thrown on the table.\r\n\r\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes\r\nof his neighbor. “Eh,” he said, negligently, “this money is not mine. I\r\nwas expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in\r\nmy absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,\r\nfather” added Dantès, “put this money back in your box—unless neighbor\r\nCaderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.”\r\n\r\n“No, my boy, no,” said Caderousse. “I am not in any want, thank God, my\r\nliving is suited to my means. Keep your money—keep it, I say;—one never\r\nhas too much;—but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged by\r\nyour offer as if I took advantage of it.”\r\n\r\n“It was offered with good will,” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I\r\nhear,—you insinuating dog, you!”\r\n\r\n“M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,” replied Dantès.\r\n\r\n“Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.”\r\n\r\n“What, did you refuse to dine with him?” said old Dantès; “and did he\r\ninvite you to dine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear father,” replied Edmond, smiling at his father’s\r\nastonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\r\n\r\n“And why did you refuse, my son?” inquired the old man.\r\n\r\n“That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,” replied the\r\nyoung man. “I was most anxious to see you.”\r\n\r\n“But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,” said Caderousse.\r\n“And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy\r\nthe owner.”\r\n\r\n“But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,” replied Dantès, “and\r\nI hope he fully understood it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one’s\r\npatrons.”\r\n\r\n“I hope to be captain without that,” said Dantès.\r\n\r\n“So much the better—so much the better! Nothing will give greater\r\npleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the\r\nSaint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès?” said the old man.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you,\r\nand know you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent\r\nto go and pay a visit to the Catalans.”\r\n\r\n“Go, my dear boy,” said old Dantès; “and Heaven bless you in your wife,\r\nas it has blessed me in my son!”\r\n\r\n“His wife!” said Caderousse; “why, how fast you go on, father Dantès;\r\nshe is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.”\r\n\r\n“No, but according to all probability she soon will be,” replied\r\nEdmond.\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes,” said Caderousse; “but you were right to return as soon as\r\npossible, my boy.”\r\n\r\n“And why?”\r\n\r\n“Because Mercédès is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack\r\nfollowers; she particularly has them by dozens.”\r\n\r\n“Really?” answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of\r\nslight uneasiness.\r\n\r\n0039m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes,” continued Caderousse, “and capital offers, too; but you\r\nknow, you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?”\r\n\r\n“Meaning to say,” replied Dantès, with a smile which but ill-concealed\r\nhis trouble, “that if I were not a captain——”\r\n\r\n“Eh—eh!” said Caderousse, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said the sailor, “I have a better opinion than you of\r\nwomen in general, and of Mercédès in particular; and I am certain that,\r\ncaptain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better—so much the better,” said Caderousse. “When one is\r\ngoing to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but\r\nnever mind that, my boy,—go and announce your arrival, and let her know\r\nall your hopes and prospects.”\r\n\r\n“I will go directly,” was Edmond’s reply; and, embracing his father,\r\nand nodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.\r\n\r\nCaderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dantès, he\r\nwent downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of\r\nthe Rue Senac.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Danglars, “did you see him?”\r\n\r\n“I have just left him,” answered Caderousse.\r\n\r\n“Did he allude to his hope of being captain?”\r\n\r\n“He spoke of it as a thing already decided.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Danglars, “he is in too much hurry, it appears to me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.”\r\n\r\n“So that he is quite elated about it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter—has already offered\r\nme his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a\r\nloan of money, as though he were a banker.”\r\n\r\n“Which you refused?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was I\r\nwho put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.\r\nDantès has no longer any occasion for assistance—he is about to become\r\na captain.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Danglars, “he is not one yet.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not,” answered Caderousse; “for\r\nif he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.”\r\n\r\n“If we choose,” replied Danglars, “he will remain what he is; and\r\nperhaps become even less than he is.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing—I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the\r\nCatalane?”\r\n\r\n“Over head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a\r\nstorm in that quarter.”\r\n\r\n0041m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I?”\r\n\r\n“It is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like Dantès?”\r\n\r\n“I never like upstarts.”\r\n\r\n“Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to\r\nbelieve, as I told you, that the future captain will find some\r\nannoyance in the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.”\r\n\r\n“What have you seen?—come, tell me!”\r\n\r\n“Well, every time I have seen Mercédès come into the city she has been\r\naccompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red\r\ncomplexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.”\r\n\r\n“Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?”\r\n\r\n“I only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean\r\nwith a fine wench of seventeen?”\r\n\r\n“And you say that Dantès has gone to the Catalans?”\r\n\r\n“He went before I came down.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go the same way; we will stop at La Réserve, and we can drink a\r\nglass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.”\r\n\r\n“Come along,” said Caderousse; “but you pay the score.”\r\n\r\n“Of course,” replied Danglars; and going quickly to the designated\r\nplace, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.\r\n\r\nPère Pamphile had seen Dantès pass not ten minutes before; and assured\r\nthat he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of\r\nthe planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were\r\nsinging their welcome to one of the first days of spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Chapter 3. The Catalans\r\n\r\nBeyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot\r\nwhere the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their\r\nwine, was the village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony\r\nquitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this\r\nday. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of\r\nits chiefs, who understood Provençal, begged the commune of Marseilles\r\nto give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors\r\nof old, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and\r\nthree months afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels\r\nwhich had brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up.\r\nThis village, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half\r\nMoorish, half Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants\r\nof the first comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three\r\nor four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory, on\r\nwhich they had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with\r\nthe Marseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their\r\noriginal customs and the costume of their mother-country as they have\r\npreserved its language.\r\n\r\nOur readers will follow us along the only street of this little\r\nvillage, and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the\r\nbeautiful dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and\r\nwithin coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and\r\nbeautiful girl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the\r\ngazelle’s, was leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in\r\nher slender delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the\r\nflowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her\r\narms, bare to the elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the\r\nArlesian Venus, moved with a kind of restless impatience, and she\r\ntapped the earth with her arched and supple foot, so as to display the\r\npure and full shape of her well-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and\r\nblue clocked, stocking. At three paces from her, seated in a chair\r\nwhich he balanced on two legs, leaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten\r\ntable, was a tall young man of twenty, or two-and-twenty, who was\r\nlooking at her with an air in which vexation and uneasiness were\r\nmingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and steady gaze\r\nof the young girl controlled his look.\r\n\r\n“You see, Mercédès,” said the young man, “here is Easter come round\r\nagain; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?”\r\n\r\n“I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be\r\nvery stupid to ask me again.”\r\n\r\n“Well, repeat it,—repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe\r\nit! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had\r\nyour mother’s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are\r\ntrifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.\r\nAh, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and\r\nto lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!”\r\n\r\n“At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,”\r\nreplied Mercédès; “you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry.\r\nI have always said to you, ‘I love you as a brother; but do not ask\r\nfrom me more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another’s.’ Is\r\nnot this true, Fernand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,” replied the young man, “Yes, you\r\nhave been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the\r\nCatalans a sacred law to intermarry?”\r\n\r\n0045m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I\r\npray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in\r\nthe conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance,\r\nliable at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier,\r\nwhat would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune,\r\nwith nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable\r\ninheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She\r\nhas been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost\r\nentirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you,\r\nand that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and\r\nI accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father’s brother,\r\nbecause we were brought up together, and still more because it would\r\ngive you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this\r\nfish which I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax\r\nI spin,—I feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.”\r\n\r\n“And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as\r\nwell as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of\r\nMarseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful\r\nhousekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?”\r\n\r\n“Fernand,” answered Mercédès, shaking her head, “a woman becomes a bad\r\nmanager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when she\r\nloves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my\r\nfriendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will\r\npromise no more than I can bestow.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” replied Fernand, “you can endure your own wretchedness\r\npatiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, Mercédès, beloved by\r\nyou, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should\r\nbecome rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a\r\nplace as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.”\r\n\r\n“You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you\r\nremain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a\r\nfisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I will do better, Mercédès. I will be a sailor; instead of the\r\ncostume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,\r\na striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.\r\nWould not that dress please you?”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,—“what do you\r\nmean? I do not understand you?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because\r\nyou are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you\r\nawait is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.”\r\n\r\n“Fernand,” cried Mercédès, “I believed you were good-hearted, and I was\r\nmistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the\r\nanger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of\r\nwhom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of\r\nthe inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died\r\nloving me and me only.” The young girl made a gesture of rage. “I\r\nunderstand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not\r\nlove you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end\r\nwould that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and\r\nsee that friendship changed into hate if you were victor. Believe me,\r\nto seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who\r\nloves that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil\r\nthoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself\r\nwith having me for your friend and sister; and besides,” she added, her\r\neyes troubled and moistened with tears, “wait, wait, Fernand; you said\r\njust now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four\r\nmonths, and during these four months there have been some terrible\r\nstorms.”\r\n\r\nFernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which\r\nflowed down the cheeks of Mercédès, although for each of these tears he\r\nwould have shed his heart’s blood; but these tears flowed for another.\r\nHe arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly\r\nstopping before Mercédès, with his eyes glowing and his hands\r\nclenched,—“Say, Mercédès,” he said, “once for all, is this your final\r\ndetermination?”\r\n\r\n“I love Edmond Dantès,” the young girl calmly replied, “and none but\r\nEdmond shall ever be my husband.”\r\n\r\n“And you will always love him?”\r\n\r\n“As long as I live.”\r\n\r\nFernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was\r\nlike a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with\r\nclenched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,—“But if he is dead——”\r\n\r\n“If he is dead, I shall die too.”\r\n\r\n“If he has forgotten you——”\r\n\r\n“Mercédès!” called a joyous voice from without,—“Mercédès!”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly\r\nleaping in excess of love, “you see he has not forgotten me, for here\r\nhe is!” And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, “Here,\r\nEdmond, here I am!”\r\n\r\nFernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight\r\nof a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and Mercédès\r\nwere clasped in each other’s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which\r\nshot into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of\r\nlight. At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness\r\nisolated them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in\r\nbroken words, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem\r\nrather the expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale,\r\nand threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the\r\nshadow. By a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself,\r\nthe young Catalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.\r\n\r\n“Ah, your pardon,” said Dantès, frowning in his turn; “I did not\r\nperceive that there were three of us.” Then, turning to Mercédès, he\r\ninquired, “Who is this gentleman?”\r\n\r\n“One who will be your best friend, Dantès, for he is my friend, my\r\ncousin, my brother; it is Fernand—the man whom, after you, Edmond, I\r\nlove the best in the world. Do you not remember him?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Dantès, and without relinquishing Mercédès’ hand clasped in\r\none of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial\r\nair. But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture,\r\nremained mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly\r\nat the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès, and then again on the gloomy\r\nand menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.\r\n\r\n“I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet\r\nan enemy here.”\r\n\r\n“An enemy!” cried Mercédès, with an angry look at her cousin. “An enemy\r\nin my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my\r\narm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house to\r\nreturn to it no more.”\r\n\r\nFernand’s eye darted lightning. “And should any misfortune occur to\r\nyou, dear Edmond,” she continued with the same calmness which proved to\r\nFernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his\r\nsinister thought, “if misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend\r\nthe highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself headlong from\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nFernand became deadly pale. “But you are deceived, Edmond,” she\r\ncontinued. “You have no enemy here—there is no one but Fernand, my\r\nbrother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.”\r\n\r\nAnd at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the\r\nCatalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and\r\noffered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave,\r\nwas broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over\r\nhim. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond’s hand when he felt he\r\nhad done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair—“Oh, who\r\nwill deliver me from this man? Wretched—wretched that I am!”\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?” exclaimed a\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nThe young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived\r\nCaderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said Caderousse, “why don’t you come? Are you really in such a\r\nhurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?”\r\n\r\n“Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,” added\r\nDanglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not\r\nsay a word.\r\n\r\n“He seems besotted,” said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee.\r\n“Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all we have\r\nbelieved?”\r\n\r\n“Why, we must inquire into that,” was Caderousse’s reply; and turning\r\ntowards the young man, said, “Well, Catalan, can’t you make up your\r\nmind?”\r\n\r\nFernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly\r\nentered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness\r\nto his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his\r\nexhausted body.\r\n\r\n“Good-day,” said he. “You called me, didn’t you?” And he fell, rather\r\nthan sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.\r\n\r\n“I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid\r\nyou would throw yourself into the sea,” said Caderousse, laughing.\r\n“Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of\r\nwine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of\r\nwater unnecessarily!”\r\n\r\nFernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into\r\nhis hands, his elbows leaning on the table.\r\n\r\n“Well, Fernand, I m"

		    "text": "Metamorphosis, by Franz Kafka\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found\r\nhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his\r\narmour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his\r\nbrown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.\r\nThe bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off\r\nany moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the\r\nrest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.\r\n\r\n“What’s happened to me?” he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a\r\nproper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between\r\nits four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out\r\non the table—Samsa was a travelling salesman—and above it there hung a\r\npicture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and\r\nhoused in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur\r\nhat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered\r\nthe whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.\r\n\r\nGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops of\r\nrain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.\r\n“How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this\r\nnonsense”, he thought, but that was something he was unable to do\r\nbecause he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present state\r\ncouldn’t get into that position. However hard he threw himself onto his\r\nright, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a\r\nhundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn’t have to look at the\r\nfloundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull\r\npain there that he had never felt before.\r\n\r\n“Oh, God”, he thought, “what a strenuous career it is that I’ve chosen!\r\nTravelling day in and day out. Doing business like this takes much more\r\neffort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there’s\r\nthe curse of travelling, worries about making train connections, bad\r\nand irregular food, contact with different people all the time so that\r\nyou can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can\r\nall go to Hell!” He felt a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself\r\nslowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift his\r\nhead better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with\r\nlots of little white spots which he didn’t know what to make of; and\r\nwhen he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly\r\nback because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\nHe slid back into his former position. “Getting up early all the time”,\r\nhe thought, “it makes you stupid. You’ve got to get enough sleep. Other\r\ntravelling salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go\r\nback to the guest house during the morning to copy out the contract,\r\nthese gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.\r\nI ought to just try that with my boss; I’d get kicked out on the spot.\r\nBut who knows, maybe that would be the best thing for me. If I didn’t\r\nhave my parents to think about I’d have given in my notice a long time\r\nago, I’d have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell\r\nhim everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He’d fall right\r\noff his desk! And it’s a funny sort of business to be sitting up there\r\nat your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,\r\nespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard\r\nof hearing. Well, there’s still some hope; once I’ve got the money\r\ntogether to pay off my parents’ debt to him—another five or six years I\r\nsuppose—that’s definitely what I’ll do. That’s when I’ll make the big\r\nchange. First of all though, I’ve got to get up, my train leaves at\r\nfive.”\r\n\r\nAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers.\r\n“God in Heaven!” he thought. It was half past six and the hands were\r\nquietly moving forwards, it was even later than half past, more like\r\nquarter to seven. Had the alarm clock not rung? He could see from the\r\nbed that it had been set for four o’clock as it should have been; it\r\ncertainly must have rung. Yes, but was it possible to quietly sleep\r\nthrough that furniture-rattling noise? True, he had not slept\r\npeacefully, but probably all the more deeply because of that. What\r\nshould he do now? The next train went at seven; if he were to catch\r\nthat he would have to rush like mad and the collection of samples was\r\nstill not packed, and he did not at all feel particularly fresh and\r\nlively. And even if he did catch the train he would not avoid his\r\nboss’s anger as the office assistant would have been there to see the\r\nfive o’clock train go, he would have put in his report about Gregor’s\r\nnot being there a long time ago. The office assistant was the boss’s\r\nman, spineless, and with no understanding. What about if he reported\r\nsick? But that would be extremely strained and suspicious as in five\r\nyears of service Gregor had never once yet been ill. His boss would\r\ncertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance\r\ncompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the\r\ndoctor’s recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed\r\nthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy. And what’s more,\r\nwould he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in fact,\r\napart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long, feel\r\ncompletely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.\r\n\r\nHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide to\r\nget out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven. There was a\r\ncautious knock at the door near his head. “Gregor”, somebody called—it\r\nwas his mother—“it’s quarter to seven. Didn’t you want to go\r\nsomewhere?” That gentle voice! Gregor was shocked when he heard his own\r\nvoice answering, it could hardly be recognised as the voice he had had\r\nbefore. As if from deep inside him, there was a painful and\r\nuncontrollable squeaking mixed in with it, the words could be made out\r\nat first but then there was a sort of echo which made them unclear,\r\nleaving the hearer unsure whether he had heard properly or not. Gregor\r\nhad wanted to give a full answer and explain everything, but in the\r\ncircumstances contented himself with saying: “Yes, mother, yes,\r\nthank-you, I’m getting up now.” The change in Gregor’s voice probably\r\ncould not be noticed outside through the wooden door, as his mother was\r\nsatisfied with this explanation and shuffled away. But this short\r\nconversation made the other members of the family aware that Gregor,\r\nagainst their expectations was still at home, and soon his father came\r\nknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist. “Gregor,\r\nGregor”, he called, “what’s wrong?” And after a short while he called\r\nagain with a warning deepness in his voice: “Gregor! Gregor!” At the\r\nother side door his sister came plaintively: “Gregor? Aren’t you well?\r\nDo you need anything?” Gregor answered to both sides: “I’m ready, now”,\r\nmaking an effort to remove all the strangeness from his voice by\r\nenunciating very carefully and putting long pauses between each,\r\nindividual word. His father went back to his breakfast, but his sister\r\nwhispered: “Gregor, open the door, I beg of you.” Gregor, however, had\r\nno thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for\r\nhis cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors\r\nat night even when he was at home.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being\r\ndisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast. Only\r\nthen would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he\r\nwould not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by lying in\r\nbed. He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in bed, perhaps\r\ncaused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned out to be pure\r\nimagination and he wondered how his imaginings would slowly resolve\r\nthemselves today. He did not have the slightest doubt that the change\r\nin his voice was nothing more than the first sign of a serious cold,\r\nwhich was an occupational hazard for travelling salesmen.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow\r\nhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves. But it became\r\ndifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad. He\r\nwould have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but instead\r\nof them he only had all those little legs continuously moving in\r\ndifferent directions, and which he was moreover unable to control. If\r\nhe wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first one that would\r\nstretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do what he wanted with\r\nthat leg, all the others seemed to be set free and would move about\r\npainfully. “This is something that can’t be done in bed”, Gregor said\r\nto himself, “so don’t keep trying to do it”.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out\r\nof the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not\r\nimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move; it\r\nwent so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he carelessly\r\nshoved himself forwards with all the force he could gather, he chose\r\nthe wrong direction, hit hard against the lower bedpost, and learned\r\nfrom the burning pain he felt that the lower part of his body might\r\nwell, at present, be the most sensitive.\r\n\r\nSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first,\r\ncarefully turning his head to the side. This he managed quite easily,\r\nand despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of his body eventually\r\nfollowed slowly in the direction of the head. But when he had at last\r\ngot his head out of the bed and into the fresh air it occurred to him\r\nthat if he let himself fall it would be a miracle if his head were not\r\ninjured, so he became afraid to carry on pushing himself forward the\r\nsame way. And he could not knock himself out now at any price; better\r\nto stay in bed than lose consciousness.\r\n\r\nIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier,\r\nbut when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching his legs as\r\nthey struggled against each other even harder than before, if that was\r\npossible, he could think of no way of bringing peace and order to this\r\nchaos. He told himself once more that it was not possible for him to\r\nstay in bed and that the most sensible thing to do would be to get free\r\nof it in whatever way he could at whatever sacrifice. At the same time,\r\nthough, he did not forget to remind himself that calm consideration was\r\nmuch better than rushing to desperate conclusions. At times like this\r\nhe would direct his eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he\r\ncould, but unfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was\r\nenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer to\r\noffer him. “Seven o’clock, already”, he said to himself when the clock\r\nstruck again, “seven o’clock, and there’s still a fog like this.” And\r\nhe lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly as if he perhaps\r\nexpected the total stillness to bring things back to their real and\r\nnatural state.\r\n\r\nBut then he said to himself: “Before it strikes quarter past seven I’ll\r\ndefinitely have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody\r\nwill have come round from work to ask what’s happened to me as well, as\r\nthey open up at work before seven o’clock.” And so he set himself to\r\nthe task of swinging the entire length of his body out of the bed all\r\nat the same time. If he succeeded in falling out of bed in this way and\r\nkept his head raised as he did so he could probably avoid injuring it.\r\nHis back seemed to be quite hard, and probably nothing would happen to\r\nit falling onto the carpet. His main concern was for the loud noise he\r\nwas bound to make, and which even through all the doors would probably\r\nraise concern if not alarm. But it was something that had to be risked.\r\n\r\nWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed—the new method\r\nwas more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and\r\nforth—it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody\r\ncame to help him. Two strong people—he had his father and the maid in\r\nmind—would have been more than enough; they would only have to push\r\ntheir arms under the dome of his back, peel him away from the bed, bend\r\ndown with the load and then be patient and careful as he swang over\r\nonto the floor, where, hopefully, the little legs would find a use.\r\nShould he really call for help though, even apart from the fact that\r\nall the doors were locked? Despite all the difficulty he was in, he\r\ncould not suppress a smile at this thought.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have\r\nbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard. The time\r\nwas now ten past seven and he would have to make a final decision very\r\nsoon. Then there was a ring at the door of the flat. “That’ll be\r\nsomeone from work”, he said to himself, and froze very still, although\r\nhis little legs only became all the more lively as they danced around.\r\nFor a moment everything remained quiet. “They’re not opening the door”,\r\nGregor said to himself, caught in some nonsensical hope. But then of\r\ncourse, the maid’s firm steps went to the door as ever and opened it.\r\nGregor only needed to hear the visitor’s first words of greeting and he\r\nknew who it was—the chief clerk himself. Why did Gregor have to be the\r\nonly one condemned to work for a company where they immediately became\r\nhighly suspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees,\r\nevery one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful\r\nand devoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he\r\ncouldn’t get out of bed if he didn’t spend at least a couple of hours\r\nin the morning on company business? Was it really not enough to let one\r\nof the trainees make enquiries—assuming enquiries were even\r\nnecessary—did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did they have\r\nto show the whole, innocent family that this was so suspicious that\r\nonly the chief clerk could be trusted to have the wisdom to investigate\r\nit? And more because these thoughts had made him upset than through any\r\nproper decision, he swang himself with all his force out of the bed.\r\nThere was a loud thump, but it wasn’t really a loud noise. His fall was\r\nsoftened a little by the carpet, and Gregor’s back was also more\r\nelastic than he had thought, which made the sound muffled and not too\r\nnoticeable. He had not held his head carefully enough, though, and hit\r\nit as he fell; annoyed and in pain, he turned it and rubbed it against\r\nthe carpet.\r\n\r\n“Something’s fallen down in there”, said the chief clerk in the room on\r\nthe left. Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort that\r\nhad happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk too; you\r\nhad to concede that it was possible. But as if in gruff reply to this\r\nquestion, the chief clerk’s firm footsteps in his highly polished boots\r\ncould now be heard in the adjoining room. From the room on his right,\r\nGregor’s sister whispered to him to let him know: “Gregor, the chief\r\nclerk is here.” “Yes, I know”, said Gregor to himself; but without\r\ndaring to raise his voice loud enough for his sister to hear him.\r\n\r\n“Gregor”, said his father now from the room to his left, “the chief\r\nclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn’t leave on the\r\nearly train. We don’t know what to say to him. And anyway, he wants to\r\nspeak to you personally. So please open up this door. I’m sure he’ll be\r\ngood enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.” Then the chief\r\nclerk called “Good morning, Mr. Samsa”. “He isn’t well”, said his\r\nmother to the chief clerk, while his father continued to speak through\r\nthe door. “He isn’t well, please believe me. Why else would Gregor have\r\nmissed a train! The lad only ever thinks about the business. It nearly\r\nmakes me cross the way he never goes out in the evenings; he’s been in\r\ntown for a week now but stayed home every evening. He sits with us in\r\nthe kitchen and just reads the paper or studies train timetables. His\r\nidea of relaxation is working with his fretsaw. He’s made a little\r\nframe, for instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you’ll be\r\namazed how nice it is; it’s hanging up in his room; you’ll see it as\r\nsoon as Gregor opens the door. Anyway, I’m glad you’re here; we\r\nwouldn’t have been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves;\r\nhe’s so stubborn; and I’m sure he isn’t well, he said this morning that\r\nhe is, but he isn’t.” “I’ll be there in a moment”, said Gregor slowly\r\nand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any word\r\nof the conversation. “Well I can’t think of any other way of explaining\r\nit, Mrs. Samsa”, said the chief clerk, “I hope it’s nothing serious.\r\nBut on the other hand, I must say that if we people in commerce ever\r\nbecome slightly unwell then, fortunately or unfortunately as you like,\r\nwe simply have to overcome it because of business considerations.” “Can\r\nthe chief clerk come in to see you now then?”, asked his father\r\nimpatiently, knocking at the door again. “No”, said Gregor. In the room\r\non his right there followed a painful silence; in the room on his left\r\nhis sister began to cry.\r\n\r\nSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably only\r\njust got up and had not even begun to get dressed. And why was she\r\ncrying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the chief\r\nclerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if that\r\nhappened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the same\r\ndemands as before? There was no need to worry about things like that\r\nyet. Gregor was still there and had not the slightest intention of\r\nabandoning his family. For the time being he just lay there on the\r\ncarpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in would seriously\r\nhave expected him to let the chief clerk in. It was only a minor\r\ndiscourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be found for it later\r\non, it was not something for which Gregor could be sacked on the spot.\r\nAnd it seemed to Gregor much more sensible to leave him now in peace\r\ninstead of disturbing him with talking at him and crying. But the\r\nothers didn’t know what was happening, they were worried, that would\r\nexcuse their behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe chief clerk now raised his voice, “Mr. Samsa”, he called to him,\r\n“what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more\r\nthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and unnecessary\r\nconcern to your parents and you fail—and I mention this just by the\r\nway—you fail to carry out your business duties in a way that is quite\r\nunheard of. I’m speaking here on behalf of your parents and of your\r\nemployer, and really must request a clear and immediate explanation. I\r\nam astonished, quite astonished. I thought I knew you as a calm and\r\nsensible person, and now you suddenly seem to be showing off with\r\npeculiar whims. This morning, your employer did suggest a possible\r\nreason for your failure to appear, it’s true—it had to do with the\r\nmoney that was recently entrusted to you—but I came near to giving him\r\nmy word of honour that that could not be the right explanation. But now\r\nthat I see your incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish\r\nwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf. And nor is your position all\r\nthat secure. I had originally intended to say all this to you in\r\nprivate, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good\r\nreason I don’t see why your parents should not also learn of it. Your\r\nturnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that it’s\r\nnot the time of year to do especially good business, we recognise that;\r\nbut there simply is no time of year to do no business at all, Mr.\r\nSamsa, we cannot allow there to be.”\r\n\r\n“But Sir”, called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in the\r\nexcitement, “I’ll open up immediately, just a moment. I’m slightly\r\nunwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven’t been able to get up. I’m\r\nstill in bed now. I’m quite fresh again now, though. I’m just getting\r\nout of bed. Just a moment. Be patient! It’s not quite as easy as I’d\r\nthought. I’m quite alright now, though. It’s shocking, what can\r\nsuddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright last night, my parents\r\nknow about it, perhaps better than me, I had a small symptom of it last\r\nnight already. They must have noticed it. I don’t know why I didn’t let\r\nyou know at work! But you always think you can get over an illness\r\nwithout staying at home. Please, don’t make my parents suffer! There’s\r\nno basis for any of the accusations you’re making; nobody’s ever said a\r\nword to me about any of these things. Maybe you haven’t read the latest\r\ncontracts I sent in. I’ll set off with the eight o’clock train, as\r\nwell, these few hours of rest have given me strength. You don’t need to\r\nwait, sir; I’ll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good\r\nas to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him!”\r\n\r\nAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was\r\nsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers—this was easily\r\ndone, probably because of the practise he had already had in bed—where\r\nhe now tried to get himself upright. He really did want to open the\r\ndoor, really did want to let them see him and to speak with the chief\r\nclerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was curious to learn\r\nwhat they would say when they caught sight of him. If they were shocked\r\nthen it would no longer be Gregor’s responsibility and he could rest.\r\nIf, however, they took everything calmly he would still have no reason\r\nto be upset, and if he hurried he really could be at the station for\r\neight o’clock. The first few times he tried to climb up on the smooth\r\nchest of drawers he just slid down again, but he finally gave himself\r\none last swing and stood there upright; the lower part of his body was\r\nin serious pain but he no longer gave any attention to it. Now he let\r\nhimself fall against the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the\r\nedges of it with his little legs. By now he had also calmed down, and\r\nkept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.\r\n\r\n“Did you understand a word of all that?” the chief clerk asked his\r\nparents, “surely he’s not trying to make fools of us”. “Oh, God!”\r\ncalled his mother, who was already in tears, “he could be seriously ill\r\nand we’re making him suffer. Grete! Grete!” she then cried. “Mother?”\r\nhis sister called from the other side. They communicated across\r\nGregor’s room. “You’ll have to go for the doctor straight away. Gregor\r\nis ill. Quick, get the doctor. Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just\r\nnow?” “That was the voice of an animal”, said the chief clerk, with a\r\ncalmness that was in contrast with his mother’s screams. “Anna! Anna!”\r\nhis father called into the kitchen through the entrance hall, clapping\r\nhis hands, “get a locksmith here, now!” And the two girls, their skirts\r\nswishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the\r\nfront door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get\r\ndressed so quickly? There was no sound of the door banging shut again;\r\nthey must have left it open; people often do in homes where something\r\nawful has happened.\r\n\r\nGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn’t\r\nunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to\r\nhim, clearer than before—perhaps his ears had become used to the sound.\r\nThey had realised, though, that there was something wrong with him, and\r\nwere ready to help. The first response to his situation had been\r\nconfident and wise, and that made him feel better. He felt that he had\r\nbeen drawn back in among people, and from the doctor and the locksmith\r\nhe expected great and surprising achievements—although he did not\r\nreally distinguish one from the other. Whatever was said next would be\r\ncrucial, so, in order to make his voice as clear as possible, he\r\ncoughed a little, but taking care to do this not too loudly as even\r\nthis might well sound different from the way that a human coughs and he\r\nwas no longer sure he could judge this for himself. Meanwhile, it had\r\nbecome very quiet in the next room. Perhaps his parents were sat at the\r\ntable whispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed\r\nagainst the door and listening.\r\n\r\nGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once\r\nthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself\r\nupright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs. He\r\nrested there a little while to recover from the effort involved and\r\nthen set himself to the task of turning the key in the lock with his\r\nmouth. He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper teeth—how was he,\r\nthen, to grasp the key?—but the lack of teeth was, of course, made up\r\nfor with a very strong jaw; using the jaw, he really was able to start\r\nthe key turning, ignoring the fact that he must have been causing some\r\nkind of damage as a brown fluid came from his mouth, flowed over the\r\nkey and dripped onto the floor. “Listen”, said the chief clerk in the\r\nnext room, “he’s turning the key.” Gregor was greatly encouraged by\r\nthis; but they all should have been calling to him, his father and his\r\nmother too: “Well done, Gregor”, they should have cried, “keep at it,\r\nkeep hold of the lock!” And with the idea that they were all excitedly\r\nfollowing his efforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying\r\nno attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned\r\nround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself upright\r\nwith his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down again with the\r\nwhole weight of his body as needed. The clear sound of the lock as it\r\nsnapped back was Gregor’s sign that he could break his concentration,\r\nand as he regained his breath he said to himself: “So, I didn’t need\r\nthe locksmith after all”. Then he lay his head on the handle of the\r\ndoor to open it completely.\r\n\r\nBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open\r\nbefore he could be seen. He had first to slowly turn himself around one\r\nof the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully if he did not\r\nwant to fall flat on his back before entering the room. He was still\r\noccupied with this difficult movement, unable to pay attention to\r\nanything else, when he heard the chief clerk exclaim a loud “Oh!”,\r\nwhich sounded like the soughing of the wind. Now he also saw him—he was\r\nthe nearest to the door—his hand pressed against his open mouth and\r\nslowly retreating as if driven by a steady and invisible force.\r\nGregor’s mother, her hair still dishevelled from bed despite the chief\r\nclerk’s being there, looked at his father. Then she unfolded her arms,\r\ntook two steps forward towards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into\r\nher skirts that spread themselves out around her as her head\r\ndisappeared down onto her breast. His father looked hostile, and\r\nclenched his fists as if wanting to knock Gregor back into his room.\r\nThen he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with\r\nhis hands and wept so that his powerful chest shook.\r\n\r\nSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the\r\nother door which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half\r\nof his body could be seen, along with his head above it which he leant\r\nover to one side as he peered out at the others. Meanwhile the day had\r\nbecome much lighter; part of the endless, grey-black building on the\r\nother side of the street—which was a hospital—could be seen quite\r\nclearly with the austere and regular line of windows piercing its\r\nfaçade; the rain was still falling, now throwing down large, individual\r\ndroplets which hit the ground one at a time. The washing up from\r\nbreakfast lay on the table; there was so much of it because, for\r\nGregor’s father, breakfast was the most important meal of the day and\r\nhe would stretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of\r\ndifferent newspapers. On the wall exactly opposite there was photograph\r\nof Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword in his hand\r\nand a carefree smile on his face as he called forth respect for his\r\nuniform and bearing. The door to the entrance hall was open and as the\r\nfront door of the flat was also open he could see onto the landing and\r\nthe stairs where they began their way down below.\r\n\r\n“Now, then”, said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have\r\nkept calm, “I’ll get dressed straight away now, pack up my samples and\r\nset off. Will you please just let me leave? You can see”, he said to\r\nthe chief clerk, “that I’m not stubborn and I like to do my job; being\r\na commercial traveller is arduous but without travelling I couldn’t\r\nearn my living. So where are you going, in to the office? Yes? Will you\r\nreport everything accurately, then? It’s quite possible for someone to\r\nbe temporarily unable to work, but that’s just the right time to\r\nremember what’s been achieved in the past and consider that later on,\r\nonce the difficulty has been removed, he will certainly work with all\r\nthe more diligence and concentration. You’re well aware that I’m\r\nseriously in debt to our employer as well as having to look after my\r\nparents and my sister, so that I’m trapped in a difficult situation,\r\nbut I will work my way out of it again. Please don’t make things any\r\nharder for me than they are already, and don’t take sides against me at\r\nthe office. I know that nobody likes the travellers. They think we earn\r\nan enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it. That’s just\r\nprejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it. But\r\nyou, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the staff, in\r\nfact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview than the boss\r\nhimself—it’s very easy for a businessman like him to make mistakes\r\nabout his employees and judge them more harshly than he should. And\r\nyou’re also well aware that we travellers spend almost the whole year\r\naway from the office, so that we can very easily fall victim to gossip\r\nand chance and groundless complaints, and it’s almost impossible to\r\ndefend yourself from that sort of thing, we don’t usually even hear\r\nabout them, or if at all it’s when we arrive back home exhausted from a\r\ntrip, and that’s when we feel the harmful effects of what’s been going\r\non without even knowing what caused them. Please, don’t go away, at\r\nleast first say something to show that you grant that I’m at least\r\npartly right!”\r\n\r\nBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to\r\nspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his\r\ntrembling shoulders as he left. He did not keep still for a moment\r\nwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door without\r\ntaking his eyes off him. He moved very gradually, as if there had been\r\nsome secret prohibition on leaving the room. It was only when he had\r\nreached the entrance hall that he made a sudden movement, drew his foot\r\nfrom the living room, and rushed forward in a panic. In the hall, he\r\nstretched his right hand far out towards the stairway as if out there,\r\nthere were some supernatural force waiting to save him.\r\n\r\nGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk\r\ngo away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into\r\nextreme danger. That was something his parents did not understand very\r\nwell; over the years, they had become convinced that this job would\r\nprovide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides, they had so much\r\nto worry about at present that they had lost sight of any thought for\r\nthe future. Gregor, though, did think about the future. The chief clerk\r\nhad to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the\r\nfuture of Gregor and his family depended on it! If only his sister were\r\nhere! She was clever; she was already in tears while Gregor was still\r\nlying peacefully on his back. And the chief clerk was a lover of women,\r\nsurely she could persuade him; she would close the front door in the\r\nentrance hall and talk him out of his shocked state. But his sister was\r\nnot there, Gregor would have to do the job himself. And without\r\nconsidering that he still was not familiar with how well he could move\r\nabout in his present state, or that his speech still might not—or\r\nprobably would not—be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself\r\nthrough the opening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,\r\nridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but\r\nGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought\r\nsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs. Hardly had\r\nthat happened than, for the first time that day, he began to feel\r\nalright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground under them;\r\nto his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they were even\r\nmaking the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and he was soon\r\nbelieving that all his sorrows would soon be finally at an end. He held\r\nback the urge to move but swayed from side to side as he crouched there\r\non the floor. His mother was not far away in front of him and seemed,\r\nat first, quite engrossed in herself, but then she suddenly jumped up\r\nwith her arms outstretched and her fingers spread shouting: “Help, for\r\npity’s sake, Help!” The way she held her head suggested she wanted to\r\nsee Gregor better, but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards\r\nshowed that she did not; she had forgotten that the table was behind\r\nher with all the breakfast things on it; when she reached the table she\r\nsat quickly down on it without knowing what she was doing; without even\r\nseeming to notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush\r\nof coffee was pouring down onto the carpet.\r\n\r\n“Mother, mother”, said Gregor gently, looking up at her. He had\r\ncompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not help\r\nhimself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of\r\ncoffee. That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from the table and\r\ninto the arms of his father as he rushed towards her. Gregor, though,\r\nhad no time to spare for his parents now; the chief clerk had already\r\nreached the stairs; with his chin on the banister, he looked back for\r\nthe last time. Gregor made a run for him; he wanted to be sure of\r\nreaching him; the chief clerk must have expected something, as he leapt\r\ndown several steps at once and disappeared; his shouts resounding all\r\naround the staircase. The flight of the chief clerk seemed,\r\nunfortunately, to put Gregor’s father into a panic as well. Until then\r\nhe had been relatively self controlled, but now, instead of running\r\nafter the chief clerk himself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he\r\nran after him, Gregor’s father seized the chief clerk’s stick in his\r\nright hand (the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with\r\nhis hat and overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with\r\nhis left, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping\r\nhis foot at him as he went. Gregor’s appeals to his father were of no\r\nhelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly\r\nturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.\r\nAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor’s mother had pulled\r\nopen a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to her face. A\r\nstrong draught of air flew in from the street towards the stairway, the\r\ncurtains flew up, the newspapers on the table fluttered and some of\r\nthem were blown onto the floor. Nothing would stop Gregor’s father as\r\nhe drove him back, making hissing noises at him like a wild man. Gregor\r\nhad never had any practice in moving backwards and was only able to go\r\nvery slowly. If Gregor had only been allowed to turn round he would\r\nhave been back in his room straight away, but he was afraid that if he\r\ntook the time to do that his father would become impatient, and there\r\nwas the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in\r\nhis father’s hand any moment. Eventually, though, Gregor realised that\r\nhe had no choice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable\r\nof going backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as\r\npossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn\r\nhimself round. It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able to\r\nsee his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact now\r\nand then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a\r\ndistance as to which way to turn. If only his father would stop that\r\nunbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused. When he had\r\nnearly finished turning round, still listening to that hissing, he made\r\na mistake and turned himself back a little the way he had just come. He\r\nwas pleased when he finally had his head in front of the doorway, but\r\nthen saw that it was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get\r\nthrough it without further difficulty. In his present mood, it\r\nobviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double\r\ndoors so that Gregor would have enough space to get through. He was\r\nmerely fixed on the idea that Gregor should be got back into his room\r\nas quickly as possible. Nor would he ever have allowed Gregor the time\r\nto get himself upright as preparation for getting through the doorway.\r\nWhat he did, making more noise than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards\r\nall the harder as if there had been nothing in the way; it sounded to\r\nGregor as if there was now more than one father behind him; it was not\r\na pleasant experience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway\r\nwithout regard for what might happen. One side of his body lifted\r\nitself, he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the\r\nwhite door and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,\r\nsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all by\r\nhimself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while\r\nthose on the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then\r\nhis father gave him a hefty shove from behind which released him from\r\nwhere he was held and sent him flying, and heavily bleeding, deep into\r\nhis room. The door was slammed shut with the stick, then, finally, all\r\nwas quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke\r\nfrom his deep and coma-like sleep. He would have woken soon afterwards\r\nanyway even if he hadn’t been disturbed, as he had had enough sleep and\r\nfelt fully rested. But he had the impression that some hurried steps\r\nand the sound of the door leading into the front room being carefully\r\nshut had woken him. The light from the electric street lamps shone\r\npalely here and there onto the ceiling and tops of the furniture, but\r\ndown below, where Gregor was, it was dark. He pushed himself over to\r\nthe door, feeling his way clumsily with his antennae—of which he was\r\nnow beginning to learn the value—in order to see what had been\r\nhappening there. The whole of his left side seemed like one, painfully\r\nstretched scar, and he limped badly on his two rows of legs. One of the\r\nlegs had been badly injured in the events of that morning—it was nearly\r\na miracle that only one of them had been—and dragged along lifelessly.\r\n\r\nIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it\r\nactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of\r\nsomething to eat. By the door there was a dish filled with sweetened\r\nmilk with little pieces of white bread floating in it. He was so\r\npleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he had been\r\nthat morning, and immediately dipped his head into the milk, nearly\r\ncovering his eyes with it. But he soon drew his head back again in\r\ndisappointment; not only did the pain in his tender left side make it\r\ndifficult to eat the food—he was only able to eat if his whole body\r\nworked together as a snuffling whole—but the milk did not taste at all\r\nnice. Milk like this was normally his favourite drink, and his sister\r\nhad certainly left it there for him because of that, but he turned,\r\nalmost against his own will, away from the dish and crawled back into\r\nthe centre of the room.\r\n\r\nThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been\r\nlit in the living room. His father at this time would normally be sat\r\nwith his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to Gregor’s\r\nmother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not a sound to\r\nbe heard. Gregor’s sister would often write and tell him about this\r\nreading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in recent times. It\r\nwas so quiet all around too, even though there must have been somebody\r\nin the flat. “What a quiet life it is the family lead”, said Gregor to\r\nhimself, and, gazing into the darkness, felt a great pride that he was\r\nable to provide a life like that in such a nice home for his sister and\r\nparents. But what now, if all this peace and wealth and comfort should\r\ncome to a horrible and frightening end? That was something that Gregor\r\ndid not want to think about too much, so he started to move about,\r\ncrawling up and down the room.\r\n\r\nOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was\r\nopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door on\r\nthe other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to enter the\r\nroom but thought better of it. Gregor went and waited immediately by\r\nthe door, resolved either to bring the timorous visitor into the room\r\nin some way or at least to find out who it was; but the door was opened\r\nno more that night and Gregor waited in vain. The previous morning\r\nwhile the doors were locked everyone had wanted to get in there to him,\r\nbut now, now that he had opened up one of the doors and the other had\r\nclearly been unlocked some time during the day, no-one came, and the\r\nkeys were in the other sides.\r\n\r\nIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room was\r\nput out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had\r\nstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as\r\nthey went away together on tip-toe. It was clear that no-one would come\r\ninto Gregor’s room any more until morning; that gave him plenty of time\r\nto think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life.\r\nFor some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced to remain\r\nmade him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor, even though he\r\nhad been living in it for five years. Hardly aware of what he was doing\r\nother than a slight feeling of shame, he hurried under the couch. It\r\npressed down on his back a little, and he was no longer able to lift\r\nhis head, but he nonetheless felt immediately at ease and his only\r\nregret was that his body was too broad to get it all underneath.\r\n\r\nHe spent the whole night there. Some of the time he passed in a light\r\nsleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of his\r\nhunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague hopes\r\nwhich, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the time being\r\nhe must remain calm, he must show patience and the greatest\r\nconsideration so that his family could bear the unpleasantness that he,\r\nin his present condition, was forced to impose on them.\r\n\r\nGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions,\r\nas early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his\r\nsister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and\r\nlooked anxiously in. She did not see him straight away, but when she\r\ndid notice him under the couch—he had to be somewhere, for God’s sake,\r\nhe couldn’t have flown away—she was so shocked that she lost control of\r\nherself and slammed the door shut again from outside. But she seemed to\r\nregret her behaviour, as she opened the door again straight away and\r\ncame in on tip-toe as if entering the room of someone seriously ill or\r\neven of a stranger. Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the\r\nedge of the couch, and watched her. Would she notice that he had left\r\nthe milk as it was, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and\r\nbring him in some other food that was more suitable? If she didn’t do\r\nit herself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,\r\nalthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the\r\ncouch, throw himself at his sister’s feet and beg her for something\r\ngood to eat. However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and\r\nlooked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some\r\nsurprise. She immediately picked it up—using a rag, not her bare\r\nhands—and carried it out. Gregor was extremely curious as to what she\r\nwould bring in its place, imagining the wildest possibilities, but he\r\nnever could have guessed what his sister, in her goodness, actually did\r\nbring. In order to test his taste, she brought him a whole selection of\r\nthings, all spread out on an old newspaper. There were old, half-rotten\r\nvegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that\r\nhad gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had\r\ndeclared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread\r\nwith butter and salt. As well as all that she had poured some water\r\ninto the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for\r\nGregor’s use, and placed it beside them. Then, out of consideration for\r\nGregor’s feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of her,\r\nshe hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so that\r\nGregor would know he could make things as comfortable for himself as he\r\nliked. Gregor’s little legs whirred, at last he could eat. What’s more,\r\nhis injuries must already have completely healed as he found no\r\ndifficulty in moving. This amazed him, as more than a month earlier he\r\nhad cut his finger slightly with a knife, he thought of how his finger\r\nhad still hurt the day before yesterday. “Am I less sensitive than I\r\nused to be, then?”, he thought, and was already sucking greedily at the\r\ncheese which had immediately, almost compellingly, attracted him much\r\nmore than the other foods on the newspaper. Quickly one after another,\r\nhis eyes watering with pleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables\r\nand the sauce; the fresh foods, on the other hand, he didn’t like at\r\nall, and even dragged the things he did want to eat a little way away\r\nfrom them because he couldn’t stand the smell. Long after he had\r\nfinished eating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly\r\nturned the key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw. He\r\nwas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he\r\nhurried back under the couch. But he needed great self-control to stay\r\nthere even for the short time that his sister was in the room, as\r\neating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he could\r\nhardly breathe in that narrow space. Half suffocating, he watched with\r\nbulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a broom and swept up\r\nthe left-overs, mixing them in with the food he had not even touched at\r\nall as if it could not be used any more. She quickly dropped it all\r\ninto a bin, closed it with its wooden lid, and carried everything out.\r\nShe had hardly turned her back before Gregor came out again from under\r\nthe couch and stretched himself.\r\n\r\nThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the morning\r\nwhile his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the second time\r\nafter everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his parents would\r\nsleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor’s sister would send\r\nthe maid away on some errand. Gregor’s father and mother certainly did\r\nnot want him to starve either, but perhaps it would have been more than\r\nthey could stand to have any more experience of his feeding than being\r\ntold about it, and perhaps his sister wanted to spare them what\r\ndistress she could as they were indeed suffering enough.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the doctor\r\nand the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the flat. As\r\nnobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister, thought that\r\nhe could understand them, so he had to be content to hear his sister’s\r\nsighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about his room. It was\r\nonly later, when she had become a little more used to everything—there\r\nwas, of course, no question of her ever becoming fully used to the\r\nsituation—that Gregor would sometimes catch a friendly comment, or at\r\nleast a comment that could be construed as friendly. “He’s enjoyed his\r\ndinner today"

		    "text": "The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBook I. The History Of A Family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch\r\nKaramazov, a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and\r\nstill remembered among us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which\r\nhappened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper\r\nplace. For the present I will only say that this “landowner”—for so we\r\nused to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own\r\nestate—was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a\r\ntype abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one\r\nof those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after\r\ntheir worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of\r\nthe smallest; he ran to dine at other men’s tables, and fastened on\r\nthem as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred\r\nthousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life\r\none of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I\r\nrepeat, it was not stupidity—the majority of these fantastical fellows\r\nare shrewd and intelligent enough—but just senselessness, and a\r\npeculiar national form of it.\r\n\r\nHe was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his\r\nfirst wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch’s first wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich\r\nand distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the\r\nMiüsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty,\r\nand moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in\r\nthis generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have\r\nmarried such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him, I won’t\r\nattempt to explain. I knew a young lady of the last “romantic”\r\ngeneration who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a\r\ngentleman, whom she might quite easily have married at any moment,\r\ninvented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing\r\nherself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high\r\nbank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her own\r\ncaprice, and to be like Shakespeare’s Ophelia. Indeed, if this\r\nprecipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less\r\npicturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most\r\nlikely the suicide would never have taken place. This is a fact, and\r\nprobably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or\r\nthree generations. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov’s action was similarly, no\r\ndoubt, an echo of other people’s ideas, and was due to the irritation\r\ncaused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, perhaps, to show her\r\nfeminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism\r\nof her family. And a pliable imagination persuaded her, we must\r\nsuppose, for a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his\r\nparasitic position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that\r\nprogressive epoch, though he was, in fact, an ill‐natured buffoon and\r\nnothing more. What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded\r\nby an elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna’s fancy.\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch’s position at the time made him specially eager for\r\nany such enterprise, for he was passionately anxious to make a career\r\nin one way or another. To attach himself to a good family and obtain a\r\ndowry was an alluring prospect. As for mutual love it did not exist\r\napparently, either in the bride or in him, in spite of Adelaïda\r\nIvanovna’s beauty. This was, perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the\r\nlife of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a voluptuous temper, and\r\nready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement. She\r\nseems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna discerned in a flash\r\nthat she had no feeling for her husband but contempt. The marriage\r\naccordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary\r\nrapidity. Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and\r\napportioned the runaway bride her dowry, the husband and wife began to\r\nlead a most disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between\r\nthem. It was said that the young wife showed incomparably more\r\ngenerosity and dignity than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known,\r\ngot hold of all her money up to twenty‐five thousand roubles as soon as\r\nshe received it, so that those thousands were lost to her for ever. The\r\nlittle village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her\r\ndowry he did his utmost for a long time to transfer to his name, by\r\nmeans of some deed of conveyance. He would probably have succeeded,\r\nmerely from her moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him, and from\r\nthe contempt and loathing he aroused by his persistent and shameless\r\nimportunity. But, fortunately, Adelaïda Ivanovna’s family intervened\r\nand circumvented his greediness. It is known for a fact that frequent\r\nfights took place between the husband and wife, but rumor had it that\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was beaten by her, for she\r\nwas a hot‐tempered, bold, dark‐browed, impatient woman, possessed of\r\nremarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the house and ran away\r\nfrom Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity student, leaving\r\nMitya, a child of three years old, in her husband’s hands. Immediately\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house, and\r\nabandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness. In the intervals he used to\r\ndrive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all of\r\nAdelaïda Ivanovna’s having left him, going into details too disgraceful\r\nfor a husband to mention in regard to his own married life. What seemed\r\nto gratify him and flatter his self‐love most was to play the\r\nridiculous part of the injured husband, and to parade his woes with\r\nembellishments.\r\n\r\n“One would think that you’d got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you\r\nseem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,” scoffers said to him. Many\r\neven added that he was glad of a new comic part in which to play the\r\nbuffoon, and that it was simply to make it funnier that he pretended to\r\nbe unaware of his ludicrous position. But, who knows, it may have been\r\nsimplicity. At last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway\r\nwife. The poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone\r\nwith her divinity student, and where she had thrown herself into a life\r\nof complete emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling\r\nabout, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he\r\ncould not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but\r\nhaving determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself\r\nfor the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just at that\r\ntime his wife’s family received the news of her death in Petersburg.\r\nShe had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of\r\ntyphus, or as another version had it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch\r\nwas drunk when he heard of his wife’s death, and the story is that he\r\nran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands\r\nto Heaven: “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,” but\r\nothers say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much so\r\nthat people were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he inspired.\r\nIt is quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at\r\nhis release, and at the same time wept for her who released him. As a\r\ngeneral rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naïve and\r\nsimple‐hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.\r\nHe Gets Rid Of His Eldest Son\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he\r\nwould bring up his children. His behavior as a father was exactly what\r\nmight be expected. He completely abandoned the child of his marriage\r\nwith Adelaïda Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his matrimonial\r\ngrievances, but simply because he forgot him. While he was wearying\r\nevery one with his tears and complaints, and turning his house into a\r\nsink of debauchery, a faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the\r\nthree‐year‐old Mitya into his care. If he hadn’t looked after him there\r\nwould have been no one even to change the baby’s little shirt.\r\n\r\nIt happened moreover that the child’s relations on his mother’s side\r\nforgot him too at first. His grandfather was no longer living, his\r\nwidow, Mitya’s grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill,\r\nwhile his daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a\r\nwhole year in old Grigory’s charge and lived with him in the servant’s\r\ncottage. But if his father had remembered him (he could not, indeed,\r\nhave been altogether unaware of his existence) he would have sent him\r\nback to the cottage, as the child would only have been in the way of\r\nhis debaucheries. But a cousin of Mitya’s mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch\r\nMiüsov, happened to return from Paris. He lived for many years\r\nafterwards abroad, but was at that time quite a young man, and\r\ndistinguished among the Miüsovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of\r\nEuropean culture, who had been in the capitals and abroad. Towards the\r\nend of his life he became a Liberal of the type common in the forties\r\nand fifties. In the course of his career he had come into contact with\r\nmany of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and abroad.\r\nHe had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in his declining\r\nyears was very fond of describing the three days of the Paris\r\nRevolution of February 1848, hinting that he himself had almost taken\r\npart in the fighting on the barricades. This was one of the most\r\ngrateful recollections of his youth. He had an independent property of\r\nabout a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. His splendid estate\r\nlay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of\r\nour famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless\r\nlawsuit, almost as soon as he came into the estate, concerning the\r\nrights of fishing in the river or wood‐cutting in the forest, I don’t\r\nknow exactly which. He regarded it as his duty as a citizen and a man\r\nof culture to open an attack upon the “clericals.” Hearing all about\r\nAdelaïda Ivanovna, whom he, of course, remembered, and in whom he had\r\nat one time been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he\r\nintervened, in spite of all his youthful indignation and contempt for\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch. He made the latter’s acquaintance for the first\r\ntime, and told him directly that he wished to undertake the child’s\r\neducation. He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch,\r\nthat when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some\r\ntime as though he did not understand what child he was talking about,\r\nand even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in\r\nthe house. The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have been\r\nsomething like the truth.\r\n\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing\r\nan unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even\r\nto his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case.\r\nThis habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of\r\npeople, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch.\r\nPyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously, and was\r\nappointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had\r\na small property, a house and land, left him by his mother. Mitya did,\r\nin fact, pass into this cousin’s keeping, but as the latter had no\r\nfamily of his own, and after securing the revenues of his estates was\r\nin haste to return at once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one\r\nof his cousins, a lady living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling\r\npermanently in Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the\r\nRevolution of February broke out, making an impression on his mind that\r\nhe remembered all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya\r\npassed into the care of one of her married daughters. I believe he\r\nchanged his home a fourth time later on. I won’t enlarge upon that now,\r\nas I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s firstborn,\r\nand must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him,\r\nwithout which I could not begin my story.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the\r\nonly one of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s three sons who grew up in the belief\r\nthat he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of\r\nage. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his\r\nstudies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to\r\nthe Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the\r\nranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal\r\nof money. He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch\r\nuntil he came of age, and until then got into debt. He saw and knew his\r\nfather, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming of age, when he\r\nvisited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his\r\nproperty. He seems not to have liked his father. He did not stay long\r\nwith him, and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in\r\nobtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future\r\npayments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was\r\nunable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement\r\nfrom his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then\r\n(this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated\r\nidea of his property. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with\r\nthis, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the\r\nyoung man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and\r\ndissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be\r\nsatisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him from time\r\nto time small doles, installments. In the end, when four years later,\r\nMitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle\r\nup once for all with his father, it turned out to his amazement that he\r\nhad nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he had\r\nreceived the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him, that by various\r\nagreements into which he had, of his own desire, entered at various\r\nprevious dates, he had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and\r\nso on. The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating,\r\nand was almost beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to\r\nthe catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first\r\nintroductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I\r\npass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s other two\r\nsons, and of their origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.\r\nThe Second Marriage And The Second Family\r\n\r\n\r\nVery shortly after getting his four‐year‐old Mitya off his hands Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight\r\nyears. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young\r\ngirl, from another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of\r\nbusiness in company with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard\r\nand a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and\r\nmanaged his business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not\r\nover‐ scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure\r\ndeacon, and was left from childhood an orphan without relations. She\r\ngrew up in the house of a general’s widow, a wealthy old lady of good\r\nposition, who was at once her benefactress and tormentor. I do not know\r\nthe details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and\r\ngentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in which she was\r\nhanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her sufferings from\r\nthe caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman, who was\r\napparently not bad‐hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant\r\nthrough idleness.\r\n\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch made her an offer; inquiries were made about him and\r\nhe was refused. But again, as in his first marriage, he proposed an\r\nelopement to the orphan girl. There is very little doubt that she would\r\nnot on any account have married him if she had known a little more\r\nabout him in time. But she lived in another province; besides, what\r\ncould a little girl of sixteen know about it, except that she would be\r\nbetter at the bottom of the river than remaining with her benefactress.\r\nSo the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch did not get a penny this time, for the general’s widow was\r\nfurious. She gave them nothing and cursed them both. But he had not\r\nreckoned on a dowry; what allured him was the remarkable beauty of the\r\ninnocent girl, above all her innocent appearance, which had a peculiar\r\nattraction for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only the\r\ncoarser types of feminine beauty.\r\n\r\n“Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,” he used to say\r\nafterwards, with his loathsome snigger. In a man so depraved this\r\nmight, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. As he had\r\nreceived no dowry with his wife, and had, so to speak, taken her “from\r\nthe halter,” he did not stand on ceremony with her. Making her feel\r\nthat she had “wronged” him, he took advantage of her phenomenal\r\nmeekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of\r\nmarriage. He gathered loose women into his house, and carried on orgies\r\nof debauchery in his wife’s presence. To show what a pass things had\r\ncome to, I may mention that Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate,\r\nargumentative servant, who had always hated his first mistress,\r\nAdelaïda Ivanovna, took the side of his new mistress. He championed her\r\ncause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a\r\nservant, and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the\r\ndisorderly women out of the house. In the end this unhappy young woman,\r\nkept in terror from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous\r\ndisease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to\r\nbe “possessed by devils.” At times after terrible fits of hysterics she\r\neven lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan and\r\nAlexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three\r\nyears later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth year, and,\r\nstrange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all his life,\r\nlike a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same thing\r\nhappened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya. They\r\nwere completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were\r\nlooked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they\r\nwere found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother.\r\nShe was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the\r\ninsult done her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as\r\nto her Sofya’s manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous\r\nsurroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers:\r\n\r\n“It serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.”\r\n\r\nExactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna’s death the general’s widow\r\nsuddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch’s\r\nhouse. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great\r\ndeal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for\r\nthose eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly\r\nupon seeing him, without any sort of explanation, she gave him two\r\ngood, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and\r\nshook him three times up and down. Then, without a word, she went\r\nstraight to the cottage to the two boys. Seeing, at the first glance,\r\nthat they were unwashed and in dirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory,\r\ntoo, a box on the ear, and announcing that she would carry off both the\r\nchildren she wrapped them just as they were in a rug, put them in the\r\ncarriage, and drove off to her own town. Grigory accepted the blow like\r\na devoted slave, without a word, and when he escorted the old lady to\r\nher carriage he made her a low bow and pronounced impressively that,\r\n“God would repay her for the orphans.” “You are a blockhead all the\r\nsame,” the old lady shouted to him as she drove away.\r\n\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing,\r\nand did not refuse the general’s widow his formal consent to any\r\nproposition in regard to his children’s education. As for the slaps she\r\nhad given him, he drove all over the town telling the story.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she left the\r\nboys in her will a thousand roubles each “for their instruction, and so\r\nthat all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be so\r\nportioned out as to last till they are twenty‐one, for it is more than\r\nadequate provision for such children. If other people think fit to\r\nthrow away their money, let them.” I have not read the will myself, but\r\nI heard there was something queer of the sort, very whimsically\r\nexpressed. The principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of\r\nNobility of the province, turned out, however, to be an honest man.\r\nWriting to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and discerning at once that he could\r\nextract nothing from him for his children’s education (though the\r\nlatter never directly refused but only procrastinated as he always did\r\nin such cases, and was, indeed, at times effusively sentimental), Yefim\r\nPetrovitch took a personal interest in the orphans. He became\r\nespecially fond of the younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as\r\none of his family. I beg the reader to note this from the beginning.\r\nAnd to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to\r\nbe met with, the young people were more indebted for their education\r\nand bringing up than to any one. He kept the two thousand roubles left\r\nto them by the general’s widow intact, so that by the time they came of\r\nage their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of interest. He\r\neducated them both at his own expense, and certainly spent far more\r\nthan a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won’t enter into a\r\ndetailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a\r\nfew of the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say\r\nthat he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid\r\nboy. At ten years old he had realized that they were living not in\r\ntheir own home but on other people’s charity, and that their father was\r\na man of whom it was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early,\r\nalmost in his infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and\r\nunusual aptitude for learning. I don’t know precisely why, but he left\r\nthe family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a\r\nMoscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated\r\nteacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare\r\nafterwards that this was all due to the “ardor for good works” of Yefim\r\nPetrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that the boy’s genius should\r\nbe trained by a teacher of genius. But neither Yefim Petrovitch nor\r\nthis teacher was living when the young man finished at the gymnasium\r\nand entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision\r\nfor the payment of the tyrannical old lady’s legacy, which had grown\r\nfrom one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to formalities\r\ninevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits for the\r\nfirst two years at the university, as he was forced to keep himself all\r\nthe time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt\r\nto communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for\r\nhim, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that from\r\nsuch a father he would get no real assistance. However that may have\r\nbeen, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting\r\nwork, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting\r\nparagraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature\r\nof “Eye‐Witness.” These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting\r\nand piquant that they were soon taken. This alone showed the young\r\nman’s practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy\r\nand unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of\r\nthe newspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better than\r\neverlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.\r\nHaving once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always\r\nkept up his connection with them, and in his latter years at the\r\nuniversity he published brilliant reviews of books upon various special\r\nsubjects, so that he became well known in literary circles. But only in\r\nhis last year he suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a\r\nfar wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and\r\nremembered him. It was rather a curious incident. When he had just left\r\nthe university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand\r\nroubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more important\r\njournals a strange article, which attracted general notice, on a\r\nsubject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing, as he was\r\na student of natural science. The article dealt with a subject which\r\nwas being debated everywhere at the time—the position of the\r\necclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the subject\r\nhe went on to explain his own view. What was most striking about the\r\narticle was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many of the Church\r\nparty regarded him unquestioningly as on their side. And yet not only\r\nthe secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause.\r\nFinally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but\r\nan impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident particularly\r\nbecause this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our\r\nneighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the\r\nquestion of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by\r\nit. Learning the author’s name, they were interested in his being a\r\nnative of the town and the son of “that Fyodor Pavlovitch.” And just\r\nthen it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.\r\n\r\nWhy Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at\r\nthe time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the\r\nfirst step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to\r\nmyself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so\r\nlearned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit\r\nsuch an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life,\r\nhardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any\r\ncircumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that\r\nhis sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here\r\nthe young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been\r\nliving with him for two months, and they were on the best possible\r\nterms. This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as\r\nwell as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, of whom we have spoken\r\nalready, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch’s first wife, happened to be\r\nin the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate. He had come from\r\nParis, which was his permanent home. I remember that he was more\r\nsurprised than any one when he made the acquaintance of the young man,\r\nwho interested him extremely, and with whom he sometimes argued and not\r\nwithout an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.\r\n\r\n“He is proud,” he used to say, “he will never be in want of pence; he\r\nhas got money enough to go abroad now. What does he want here? Every\r\none can see that he hasn’t come for money, for his father would never\r\ngive him any. He has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his\r\nfather can’t do without him. They get on so well together!”\r\n\r\nThat was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over\r\nhis father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and\r\neven seemed at times ready to obey his son, though often extremely and\r\neven spitefully perverse.\r\n\r\nIt was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the\r\nrequest of, and in the interests of, his elder brother, Dmitri, whom he\r\nsaw for the first time on this very visit, though he had before leaving\r\nMoscow been in correspondence with him about an important matter of\r\nmore concern to Dmitri than himself. What that business was the reader\r\nwill learn fully in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special\r\ncircumstance I still felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure,\r\nand thought his visit rather mysterious.\r\n\r\nI may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator\r\nbetween his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open\r\nquarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of\r\nits members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother,\r\nAlexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the\r\nthree to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult\r\nto speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account\r\nof him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to\r\nintroduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes,\r\nhe had been for the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to\r\nbe cloistered there for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.\r\nThe Third Son, Alyosha\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty‐fourth year at\r\nthe time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty‐seven. First of\r\nall, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic,\r\nand, in my opinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give\r\nmy full opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of\r\nhumanity, and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at\r\nthat time it struck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul\r\nstruggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of\r\nlove. And the reason this life struck him in this way was that he found\r\nin it at that time, as he thought, an extraordinary being, our\r\ncelebrated elder, Zossima, to whom he became attached with all the warm\r\nfirst love of his ardent heart. But I do not dispute that he was very\r\nstrange even at that time, and had been so indeed from his cradle. I\r\nhave mentioned already, by the way, that though he lost his mother in\r\nhis fourth year he remembered her all his life—her face, her caresses,\r\n“as though she stood living before me.” Such memories may persist, as\r\nevery one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but\r\nscarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out\r\nof darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all\r\nfaded and disappeared except that fragment. That is how it was with\r\nhim. He remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the\r\nslanting rays of the setting sun (that he recalled most vividly of\r\nall); in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp,\r\nand on her knees before the image his mother, sobbing hysterically with\r\ncries and moans, snatching him up in both arms, squeezing him close\r\ntill it hurt, and praying for him to the Mother of God, holding him out\r\nin both arms to the image as though to put him under the Mother’s\r\nprotection ... and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him from her\r\nin terror. That was the picture! And Alyosha remembered his mother’s\r\nface at that minute. He used to say that it was frenzied but beautiful\r\nas he remembered. But he rarely cared to speak of this memory to any\r\none. In his childhood and youth he was by no means expansive, and\r\ntalked little indeed, but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability;\r\nquite the contrary, from something different, from a sort of inner\r\npreoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people, but\r\nso important to him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on\r\naccount of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life\r\nto put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a\r\nsimpleton or naïve person. There was something about him which made one\r\nfeel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did not\r\ncare to be a judge of others—that he would never take it upon himself\r\nto criticize and would never condemn any one for anything. He seemed,\r\nindeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though\r\noften grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could\r\nsurprise or frighten him even in his earliest youth. Coming at twenty\r\nto his father’s house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he,\r\nchaste and pure as he was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on\r\nwas unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or\r\ncondemnation. His father, who had once been in a dependent position,\r\nand so was sensitive and ready to take offense, met him at first with\r\ndistrust and sullenness. “He does not say much,” he used to say, “and\r\nthinks the more.” But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he took to\r\nembracing him and kissing him terribly often, with drunken tears, with\r\nsottish sentimentality, yet he evidently felt a real and deep affection\r\nfor him, such as he had never been capable of feeling for any one\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nEvery one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he went, and it was so\r\nfrom his earliest childhood. When he entered the household of his\r\npatron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he gained the hearts\r\nof all the family, so that they looked on him quite as their own child.\r\nYet he entered the house at such a tender age that he could not have\r\nacted from design nor artfulness in winning affection. So that the gift\r\nof making himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him,\r\nin his very nature, so to speak. It was the same at school, though he\r\nseemed to be just one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes\r\nridiculed, and even disliked by their schoolfellows. He was dreamy, for\r\ninstance, and rather solitary. From his earliest childhood he was fond\r\nof creeping into a corner to read, and yet he was a general favorite\r\nall the while he was at school. He was rarely playful or merry, but any\r\none could see at the first glance that this was not from any\r\nsullenness. On the contrary he was bright and good‐tempered. He never\r\ntried to show off among his schoolfellows. Perhaps because of this, he\r\nwas never afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that\r\nhe was not proud of his fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he\r\nwas bold and courageous. He never resented an insult. It would happen\r\nthat an hour after the offense he would address the offender or answer\r\nsome question with as trustful and candid an expression as though\r\nnothing had happened between them. And it was not that he seemed to\r\nhave forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront, but simply that\r\nhe did not regard it as an affront, and this completely conquered and\r\ncaptivated the boys. He had one characteristic which made all his\r\nschoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to mock at him, not\r\nfrom malice but because it amused them. This characteristic was a wild\r\nfanatical modesty and chastity. He could not bear to hear certain words\r\nand certain conversations about women. There are “certain” words and\r\nconversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in schools. Boys pure\r\nin mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among\r\nthemselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which\r\neven soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak. More than that, much\r\nthat soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite\r\nyoung children of our intellectual and higher classes. There is no\r\nmoral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is the\r\nappearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as something\r\nrefined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation. Seeing that Alyosha\r\nKaramazov put his fingers in his ears when they talked of “that,” they\r\nused sometimes to crowd round him, pull his hands away, and shout\r\nnastiness into both ears, while he struggled, slipped to the floor,\r\ntried to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring\r\ntheir insults in silence. But at last they left him alone and gave up\r\ntaunting him with being a “regular girl,” and what’s more they looked\r\nupon it with compassion as a weakness. He was always one of the best in\r\nthe class but was never first.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Yefim Petrovitch’s death Alyosha had two more years to\r\ncomplete at the provincial gymnasium. The inconsolable widow went\r\nalmost immediately after his death for a long visit to Italy with her\r\nwhole family, which consisted only of women and girls. Alyosha went to\r\nlive in the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies\r\nwhom he had never seen before. On what terms he lived with them he did\r\nnot know himself. It was very characteristic of him, indeed, that he\r\nnever cared at whose expense he was living. In that respect he was a\r\nstriking contrast to his elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty\r\nfor his first two years in the university, maintained himself by his\r\nown efforts, and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living\r\nat the expense of his benefactor. But this strange trait in Alyosha’s\r\ncharacter must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the\r\nslightest acquaintance with him any one would have perceived that\r\nAlyosha was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious\r\nenthusiast, who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a\r\nlarge fortune, would not hesitate to give it away for the asking,\r\neither for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue. In general he\r\nseemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a\r\nliteral sense. When he was given pocket‐money, which he never asked\r\nfor, he was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a\r\nmoment, or he kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive on the\r\nscore of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following\r\njudgment, after getting to know Alyosha:\r\n\r\n“Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone\r\nwithout a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a million\r\ninhabitants, and he would not come to harm, he would not die of cold\r\nand hunger, for he would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he were\r\nnot, he would find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him no\r\neffort or humiliation. And to shelter him would be no burden, but, on\r\nthe contrary, would probably be looked on as a pleasure.”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish his studies at the gymnasium. A year before the end\r\nof the course he suddenly announced to the ladies that he was going to\r\nsee his father about a plan which had occurred to him. They were sorry\r\nand unwilling to let him go. The journey was not an expensive one, and\r\nthe ladies would not let him pawn his watch, a parting present from his\r\nbenefactor’s family. They provided him liberally with money and even\r\nfitted him out with new clothes and linen. But he returned half the\r\nmoney they gave him, saying that he intended to go third class. On his\r\narrival in the town he made no answer to his father’s first inquiry why\r\nhe had come before completing his studies, and seemed, so they say,\r\nunusually thoughtful. It soon became apparent that he was looking for\r\nhis mother’s tomb. He practically acknowledged at the time that that\r\nwas the only object of his visit. But it can hardly have been the whole\r\nreason of it. It is more probable that he himself did not understand\r\nand could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his soul, and drawn\r\nhim irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable path. Fyodor\r\nPavlovitch could not show him where his second wife was buried, for he\r\nhad never visited her grave since he had thrown earth upon her coffin,\r\nand in the course of years had entirely forgotten where she was buried.\r\n\r\nFyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not been\r\nliving in our town. Three or four years after his wife’s death he had\r\ngone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he\r\nspent several years. He made the acquaintance at first, in his own\r\nwords, “of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,” and ended by\r\nbeing received by “Jews high and low alike.” It may be presumed that at\r\nthis period he developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding\r\nmoney. He finally returned to our town only three years before\r\nAlyosha’s arrival. His former acquaintances found him looking terribly\r\naged, although he was by no means an old man. He behaved not exactly\r\nwith more dignity but with more effrontery. The former buffoon showed\r\nan insolent propensity for making buffoons of others. His depravity\r\nwith women was not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting.\r\nIn a short time he opened a great number of new taverns in the\r\ndistrict. It was evident that he had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles\r\nor not much less. Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were\r\nsoon in his debt, and, of course, had given good security. Of late,\r\ntoo, he looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more\r\nuneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing\r\nand go on with another, as though he were letting himself go\r\naltogether. He was more and more frequently drunk. And, if it had not\r\nbeen for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged\r\nconsiderably too, and used to look after him sometimes almost like a\r\ntutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.\r\nAlyosha’s arrival seemed to affect even his moral side, as though\r\nsomething had awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been\r\ndead in his soul.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” he used often to say, looking at Alyosha, “that you are\r\nlike her, ‘the crazy woman’ ”—that was what he used to call his dead\r\nwife, Alyosha’s mother. Grigory it was who pointed out the “crazy\r\nwoman’s” grave to Alyosha. He took him to our town cemetery and showed\r\nhim in a remote corner a cast‐iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept,\r\non which were inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date\r\nof her death, and below a four‐lined verse, such as are commonly used\r\non old‐fashioned middle‐class tombs. To Alyosha’s amazement this tomb\r\nturned out to be Grigory’s doing. He had put it up on the poor “crazy\r\nwoman’s” grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had\r\noften pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the\r\ngrave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the\r\nsight of his mother’s grave. He only listened to Grigory’s minute and\r\nsolemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood with bowed head\r\nand walked away without uttering a word. It was perhaps a year before\r\nhe visited the cemetery again. But this little episode was not without\r\nan influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch—and a very original one. He\r\nsuddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems\r\nfor the soul of his wife; but not for the second, Alyosha’s mother, the\r\n“crazy woman,” but for the first, Adelaïda Ivanovna, who used to thrash\r\nhim. In the evening of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks\r\nto Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; he had probably\r\nnever put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses\r\nof sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at\r\nthis time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the\r\nlife he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always\r\ninsolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep\r\nwrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam’s apple hung below his sharp\r\nchin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive,\r\nsensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips,\r\nbetween which could be seen little stumps of black de"

And why have stood so long\r\nuntenanted?\r\n\r\nJohn laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\r\n\r\nJohn is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an\r\nintense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of\r\nthings not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\r\n\r\nJohn is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living soul,\r\nof course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\r\nmind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.\r\n\r\nYou see, he does not believe I am sick!\r\n\r\nAnd what can one do?\r\n\r\nIf a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends\r\nand relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\r\ntemporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what is one\r\nto do?\r\n\r\nMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says\r\nthe same thing.\r\n\r\nSo I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and\r\njourneys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to “work”\r\nuntil I am well again.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\r\nwould do me good.\r\n\r\nBut what is one to do?\r\n\r\nI did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good\r\ndeal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.\r\n\r\nI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and\r\nmore society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do\r\nis to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from\r\nthe road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of\r\nEnglish places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and\r\ngates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners\r\nand people.\r\n\r\nThere is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden—large and shady,\r\nfull of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors\r\nwith seats under them.\r\n\r\nThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\r\n\r\nThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\r\nco-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\r\n\r\nThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\r\nsomething strange about the house—I can feel it.\r\n\r\nI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\r\nwas a draught, and shut the window.\r\n\r\nI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to\r\nbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\r\n\r\nBut John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\r\ntake pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\r\nvery tired.\r\n\r\nI don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\r\npiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\r\nchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no\r\nnear room for him if he took another.\r\n\r\nHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\r\ncare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\r\n\r\nHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\r\nrest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your\r\nstrength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;\r\nbut air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the\r\ntop of the house.\r\n\r\nIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\r\nall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\r\nplayground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred\r\nfor little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\r\n\r\nThe paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is\r\nstripped off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of my bed,\r\nabout as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of\r\nthe room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\r\n\r\nOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic\r\nsin.\r\n\r\nIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to\r\nconstantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame,\r\nuncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit\r\nsuicide—plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in\r\nunheard-of contradictions.\r\n\r\nThe color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean\r\nyellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\r\n\r\nIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNo wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to\r\nlive in this room long.\r\n\r\nThere comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me write a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nWe have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before,\r\nsince that first day.\r\n\r\nI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there\r\nis nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\r\n\r\nI am glad my case is not serious!\r\n\r\nBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\r\n\r\nJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no\r\nreason to suffer, and that satisfies him.\r\n\r\nOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\r\nduty in any way!\r\n\r\nI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\r\nhere I am a comparative burden already!\r\n\r\nNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am\r\nable—to dress and entertain, and order things.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\r\n\r\nAnd yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\r\n\r\nI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\r\nthis wallpaper!\r\n\r\nAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\r\nwas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\r\nnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\r\n\r\nHe said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\r\nbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head\r\nof the stairs, and so on.\r\n\r\n“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\r\ndon’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.”\r\n\r\n“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and\r\nsaid he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into\r\nthe bargain.\r\n\r\nBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\r\n\r\nIt is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of\r\ncourse, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a\r\nwhim.\r\n\r\nI’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded\r\narbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\r\n\r\nOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private\r\nwharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that\r\nruns down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in\r\nthese numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give\r\nway to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and\r\nhabit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to\r\nall manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good\r\nsense to check the tendency. So I try.\r\n\r\nI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\r\nwould relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\r\n\r\nBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.\r\n\r\nIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my\r\nwork. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and\r\nJulia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put\r\nfire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people\r\nabout now.\r\n\r\nI wish I could get well faster.\r\n\r\nBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew\r\nwhat a vicious influence it had!\r\n\r\nThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck\r\nand two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.\r\n\r\nI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\r\neverlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\r\nunblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\r\ndidn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\r\nhigher than the other.\r\n\r\nI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\r\nknow how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and\r\nget more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain\r\nfurniture than most children could find in a toy-store.\r\n\r\nI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to\r\nhave, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\r\n\r\nI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I\r\ncould always hop into that chair and be safe.\r\n\r\nThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\r\nwe had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as\r\na playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\r\nnever saw such ravages as the children have made here.\r\n\r\nThe wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\r\ncloser than a brother—they must have had perseverance as well as\r\nhatred.\r\n\r\nThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\r\nitself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is\r\nall we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\r\n\r\nBut I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.\r\n\r\nThere comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful\r\nof me! I must not let her find me writing.\r\n\r\nShe is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\r\nprofession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\r\nsick!\r\n\r\nBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThere is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road,\r\nand one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too,\r\nfull of great elms and velvet meadows.\r\n\r\nThis wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\r\nparticularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\r\nand not clearly then.\r\n\r\nBut in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I\r\ncan see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to\r\nsulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\r\n\r\nThere’s sister on the stairs!\r\n\r\nWell, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired\r\nout. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we\r\njust had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\r\n\r\nOf course I didn’t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\r\n\r\nBut it tired me all the same.\r\n\r\nJohn says if I don’t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell\r\nin the fall.\r\n\r\nBut I don’t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his\r\nhands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more\r\nso!\r\n\r\nBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\r\n\r\nI don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for\r\nanything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\r\n\r\nI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\r\n\r\nOf course I don’t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\r\nserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\r\n\r\nSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\r\nporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\r\n\r\nI’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\r\nbecause of the wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIt dwells in my mind so!\r\n\r\nI lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and\r\nfollow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I\r\nassure you. I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over\r\nthere where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth\r\ntime that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was\r\nnot arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition,\r\nor symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\r\n\r\nIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and\r\nflourishes—a kind of “debased Romanesque” with delirium tremens—go\r\nwaddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling\r\noutlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of\r\nwallowing seaweeds in full chase.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I\r\nexhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds\r\nwonderfully to the confusion.\r\n\r\nThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when\r\nthe cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can\r\nalmost fancy radiation after all,—the interminable grotesques seem to\r\nform around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal\r\ndistraction.\r\n\r\nIt makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.\r\n\r\nI don’t know why I should write this.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to.\r\n\r\nI don’t feel able.\r\n\r\nAnd I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and\r\nthink in some way—it is such a relief!\r\n\r\nBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\r\n\r\nHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\r\n\r\nJohn says I musn’t lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and\r\nlots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nDear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried\r\nto have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell\r\nhim how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and\r\nJulia.\r\n\r\nBut he said I wasn’t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got\r\nthere; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was\r\ncrying before I had finished.\r\n\r\nIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this\r\nnervous weakness, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\r\nand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\r\nmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\r\n\r\nHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my\r\nwill and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\r\n\r\nThere’s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to\r\noccupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper.\r\n\r\nIf we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate\r\nescape! Why, I wouldn’t have a child of mine, an impressionable little\r\nthing, live in such a room for worlds.\r\n\r\nI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here\r\nafter all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\r\n\r\nOf course I never mention it to them any more,—I am too wise,—but I\r\nkeep watch of it all the same.\r\n\r\nThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\r\n\r\nBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\r\n\r\nIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.\r\n\r\nAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\r\npattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\r\nwould take me away from here!\r\n\r\nIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\r\nand because he loves me so.\r\n\r\nBut I tried it last night.\r\n\r\nIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\r\n\r\nI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\r\none window or another.\r\n\r\nJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\r\nthe moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\r\n\r\nThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\r\nwanted to get out.\r\n\r\nI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and\r\nwhen I came back John was awake.\r\n\r\n“What is it, little girl?” he said. “Don’t go walking about like\r\nthat—you’ll get cold.”\r\n\r\nI thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was\r\nnot gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\r\n\r\n“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\r\ncan’t see how to leave before.\r\n\r\n“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town\r\njust now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but\r\nyou really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a\r\ndoctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your\r\nappetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t weigh a bit more,” said I, “nor as much; and my appetite may\r\nbe better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the\r\nmorning when you are away.”\r\n\r\n“Bless her little heart!” said he with a big hug; “she shall be as sick\r\nas she pleases! But now let’s improve the shining hours by going to\r\nsleep, and talk about it in the morning!”\r\n\r\n“And you won’t go away?” I asked gloomily.\r\n\r\n“Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will\r\ntake a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house\r\nready. Really, dear, you are better!”\r\n\r\n“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\r\nstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\r\ncould not say another word.\r\n\r\n“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s\r\nsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let\r\nthat idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\r\nfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\r\nfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”\r\n\r\nSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before\r\nlong. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn’t,—I lay there for\r\nhours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern\r\nreally did move together or separately.\r\n\r\nOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a\r\ndefiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\r\n\r\nThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating\r\nenough, but the pattern is torturing.\r\n\r\nYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in\r\nfollowing, it turns a back somersault and there you are. It slaps you\r\nin the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.\r\nIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of\r\ntoadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions,—why, that is\r\nsomething like it.\r\n\r\nThat is, sometimes!\r\n\r\nThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems\r\nto notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shoots in through the east window—I always watch for that\r\nfirst long, straight ray—it changes so quickly that I never can quite\r\nbelieve it.\r\n\r\nThat is why I watch it always.\r\n\r\nBy moonlight—the moon shines in all night when there is a moon—I\r\nwouldn’t know it was the same paper.\r\n\r\nAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and\r\nworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,\r\nand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.\r\n\r\nI didn’t realize for a long time what the thing was that showed\r\nbehind,—that dim sub-pattern,—but now I am quite sure it is a woman.\r\n\r\nBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps\r\nher so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.\r\n\r\nI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep\r\nall I can.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\nIt is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don’t tell them I’m awake,—oh, no!\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I am getting a little afraid of John.\r\n\r\nHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that\r\nperhaps it is the paper!\r\n\r\nI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into\r\nthe room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I’ve caught him\r\nseveral times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie\r\nwith her hand on it once.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a\r\nvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she\r\nwas doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught\r\nstealing, and looked quite angry—asked me why I should frighten her so!\r\n\r\nThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she\r\nhad found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished\r\nwe would be more careful!\r\n\r\nDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,\r\nand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\r\n\r\nLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\r\nsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\r\nbetter, and am more quiet than I was.\r\n\r\nJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other\r\nday, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.\r\n\r\nI turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\r\nbecause of the wallpaper—he would make fun of me. He might even want to\r\ntake me away.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week\r\nmore, and I think that will be enough.\r\n\r\nI’m feeling ever so much better! I don’t sleep much at night, for it is\r\nso interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the\r\ndaytime.\r\n\r\nIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\r\n\r\nThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all\r\nover it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried\r\nconscientiously.\r\n\r\nIt is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all\r\nthe yellow things I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups, but\r\nold foul, bad yellow things.\r\n\r\nBut there is something else about that paper—the smell! I noticed it\r\nthe moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was\r\nnot bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the\r\nwindows are open or not, the smell is here.\r\n\r\nIt creeps all over the house.\r\n\r\nI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding\r\nin the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\r\n\r\nIt gets into my hair.\r\n\r\nEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise\r\nit—there is that smell!\r\n\r\nSuch a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,\r\nto find what it smelled like.\r\n\r\nIt is not bad—at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most\r\nenduring odor I ever met.\r\n\r\nIn this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it\r\nhanging over me.\r\n\r\nIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\r\nhouse—to reach the smell.\r\n\r\nBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like\r\nis the color of the paper! A yellow smell.\r\n\r\nThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A\r\nstreak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of\r\nfurniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had\r\nbeen rubbed over and over.\r\n\r\nI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for.\r\nRound and round and round—round and round and round—it makes me dizzy!\r\n\r\nI really have discovered something at last.\r\n\r\nThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally\r\nfound out.\r\n\r\nThe front pattern does move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!\r\n\r\nSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\r\nonly one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\r\nspots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\r\n\r\nAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\r\nthrough that pattern—it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\r\nmany heads.\r\n\r\nThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns\r\nthem upside-down, and makes their eyes white!\r\n\r\nIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\r\n\r\nI think that woman gets out in the daytime!\r\n\r\nAnd I’ll tell you why—privately—I’ve seen her!\r\n\r\nI can see her out of every one of my windows!\r\n\r\nIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most\r\nwomen do not creep by daylight.\r\n\r\nI see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in\r\nthose dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.\r\n\r\nI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\r\ncarriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\r\n\r\nI don’t blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught\r\ncreeping by daylight!\r\n\r\nI always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can’t do it at\r\nnight, for I know John would suspect something at once.\r\n\r\nAnd John is so queer now, that I don’t want to irritate him. I wish he\r\nwould take another room! Besides, I don’t want anybody to get that\r\nwoman out at night but myself.\r\n\r\nI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\r\n\r\nBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\r\n\r\nAnd though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\r\nturn!\r\n\r\nI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\r\nfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\r\n\r\nIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\r\nto try it, little by little.\r\n\r\nI have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\r\nIt does not do to trust people too much.\r\n\r\nThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\r\nis beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.\r\nShe had a very good report to give.\r\n\r\nShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\r\n\r\nJohn knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!\r\n\r\nHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very\r\nloving and kind.\r\n\r\nAs if I couldn’t see through him!\r\n\r\nStill, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly\r\naffected by it.\r\n\r\nHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town\r\nover night, and won’t be out until this evening.\r\n\r\nJennie wanted to sleep with me—the sly thing! but I told her I should\r\nundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.\r\n\r\nThat was clever, for really I wasn’t alone a bit! As soon as it was\r\nmoonlight, and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I\r\ngot up and ran to help her.\r\n\r\nI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we\r\nhad peeled off yards of that paper.\r\n\r\nA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.\r\n\r\nAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me\r\nI declared I would finish it to-day!\r\n\r\nWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again\r\nto leave things as they were before.\r\n\r\nJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I\r\ndid it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and said she wouldn’t mind doing it herself, but I must not\r\nget tired.\r\n\r\nHow she betrayed herself that time!\r\n\r\nBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me—not alive!\r\n\r\nShe tried to get me out of the room—it was too patent! But I said it\r\nwas so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down\r\nagain and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner—I would\r\ncall when I woke.\r\n\r\nSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,\r\nand there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the\r\ncanvas mattress we found on it.\r\n\r\nWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.\r\n\r\nHow those children did tear about here!\r\n\r\nThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!\r\n\r\nBut I must get to work.\r\n\r\nI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.\r\n\r\nI don’t want to go out, and I don’t want to have anybody come in, till\r\nJohn comes.\r\n\r\nI want to astonish him.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman\r\ndoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!\r\n\r\nBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!\r\n\r\nThis bed will not move!\r\n\r\nI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I\r\nbit off a little piece at one corner—but it hurt my teeth.\r\n\r\nThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It\r\nsticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled\r\nheads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with\r\nderision!\r\n\r\nI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the\r\nwindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nBesides I wouldn’t do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step\r\nlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.\r\n\r\nI don’t like to look out of the windows even—there are so many of those\r\ncreeping women, and they creep so fast.\r\n\r\nI wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as I did?\r\n\r\nBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope—you don’t get me\r\nout in the road there!\r\n\r\nI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes\r\nnight, and that is hard!\r\n\r\nIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I\r\nplease!\r\n\r\nI don’t want to go outside. I won’t, even if Jennie asks me to.\r\n\r\nFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green\r\ninstead of yellow.\r\n\r\nBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits\r\nin that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.\r\n\r\nWhy, there’s John at the door!\r\n\r\nIt is no use, young man, you can’t open it!\r\n\r\nHow he does call and pound!\r\n\r\nNow he’s crying for an axe.\r\n\r\nIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!\r\n\r\n“John dear!” said I in the gentlest voice, “the key is down by the\r\nfront steps, under a plantain leaf!”\r\n\r\nThat silenced him for a few moments.\r\n\r\nThen he said—very quietly indeed, “Open the door, my darling!”\r\n\r\n“I can’t,” said I. “The key is down by the front door under a plantain\r\nleaf!”\r\n\r\nAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and\r\nsaid it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it, of course,\r\nand came in. He stopped short by the door.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” he cried. “For God’s sake, what are you doing!”\r\n\r\nI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got out at last,” said I, “in spite of you and Jane! And I’ve\r\npulled off most of the paper, so you can’t put me back!”\r\n\r\nNow why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my\r\npath by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE YELLOW WALLPAPER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1952-0.txt or 1952-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/5/1952/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

		    "text": "A Modest Proposal, by Jonathan Swift\r\n\r\nA Modest Proposal\r\n\r\nFor preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,\r\nfrom being a burden on their parents or country,\r\nand for making them beneficial to the publick.\r\n\r\nby Dr. Jonathan Swift\r\n\r\n1729\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,\r\nor travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and\r\ncabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,\r\nfour, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for\r\nan alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest\r\nlivelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg\r\nsustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn\r\nthieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight\r\nfor the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.\r\n\r\nI think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of\r\nchildren in the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their\r\nmothers, and frequently of their fathers, is in the present deplorable\r\nstate of the kingdom, a very great additional grievance; and therefore\r\nwhoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these\r\nchildren sound and useful members of the commonwealth, would deserve so\r\nwell of the publick, as to have his statue set up for a preserver of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nBut my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for\r\nthe children of professed beggars: it is of a much greater extent, and\r\nshall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age, who are\r\nborn of parents in effect as little able to support them, as those who\r\ndemand our charity in the streets.\r\n\r\nAs to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this\r\nimportant subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of our\r\nprojectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in their\r\ncomputation. It is true, a child just dropt from its dam, may be\r\nsupported by her milk, for a solar year, with little other nourishment:\r\nat most not above the value of two shillings, which the mother may\r\ncertainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful occupation of\r\nbegging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to provide\r\nfor them in such a manner, as, instead of being a charge upon their\r\nparents, or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of\r\ntheir lives, they shall, on the contrary, contribute to the feeding,\r\nand partly to the clothing of many thousands.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will\r\nprevent those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women\r\nmurdering their bastard children, alas! too frequent among us,\r\nsacrificing the poor innocent babes, I doubt, more to avoid the expence\r\nthan the shame, which would move tears and pity in the most savage and\r\ninhuman breast.\r\n\r\nThe number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million\r\nand a half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred\r\nthousand couple, whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract\r\nthirty thousand couple, who are able to maintain their own children,\r\n(although I apprehend there cannot be so many under the present\r\ndistresses of the kingdom) but this being granted, there will remain a\r\nhundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again subtract fifty thousand,\r\nfor those women who miscarry, or whose children die by accident or\r\ndisease within the year. There only remain a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore\r\nis, How this number shall be reared and provided for? which, as I have\r\nalready said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly\r\nimpossible by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither\r\nemploy them in handicraft or agriculture; they neither build houses, (I\r\nmean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can very seldom pick up a\r\nlivelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where\r\nthey are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments\r\nmuch earlier; during which time they can however be properly looked\r\nupon only as probationers; as I have been informed by a principal\r\ngentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me, that he never\r\nknew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of\r\nthe kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.\r\n\r\nI am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl, before twelve\r\nyears old, is no saleable commodity, and even when they come to this\r\nage, they will not yield above three pounds, or three pounds and half a\r\ncrown at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to\r\nthe parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriments and rags having been\r\nat least four times that value.\r\n\r\nI shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will\r\nnot be liable to the least objection.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in\r\nLondon, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a\r\nmost delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted,\r\nbaked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a\r\nfricasee, or a ragoust.\r\n\r\nI do therefore humbly offer it to publick consideration, that of the\r\nhundred and twenty thousand children, already computed, twenty thousand\r\nmay be reserved for breed, whereof only one fourth part to be males;\r\nwhich is more than we allow to sheep, black cattle, or swine, and my\r\nreason is, that these children are seldom the fruits of marriage, a\r\ncircumstance not much regarded by our savages, therefore, one male will\r\nbe sufficient to serve four females. That the remaining hundred\r\nthousand may, at a year old, be offered in sale to the persons of\r\nquality and fortune, through the kingdom, always advising the mother to\r\nlet them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them\r\nplump, and fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an\r\nentertainment for friends, and when the family dines alone, the fore or\r\nhind quarter will make a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little\r\npepper or salt, will be very good boiled on the fourth day, especially\r\nin winter.\r\n\r\nI have reckoned upon a medium, that a child just born will weigh 12\r\npounds, and in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, encreaseth to 28\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nI grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for\r\nlandlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem\r\nto have the best title to the children.\r\n\r\nInfant’s flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more\r\nplentiful in March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a\r\ngrave author, an eminent French physician, that fish being a prolifick\r\ndyet, there are more children born in Roman Catholick countries about\r\nnine months after Lent, than at any other season; therefore, reckoning\r\na year after Lent, the markets will be more glutted than usual, because\r\nthe number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom,\r\nand therefore it will have one other collateral advantage, by lessening\r\nthe number of Papists among us.\r\n\r\nI have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar’s child (in\r\nwhich list I reckon all cottagers, labourers, and four-fifths of the\r\nfarmers) to be about two shillings per annum, rags included; and I\r\nbelieve no gentleman would repine to give ten shillings for the carcass\r\nof a good fat child, which, as I have said, will make four dishes of\r\nexcellent nutritive meat, when he hath only some particular friend, or\r\nhis own family to dine with him. Thus the squire will learn to be a\r\ngood landlord, and grow popular among his tenants, the mother will have\r\neight shillings neat profit, and be fit for work till she produces\r\nanother child.\r\n\r\nThose who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may\r\nflay the carcass; the skin of which, artificially dressed, will make\r\nadmirable gloves for ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.\r\n\r\nAs to our City of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose,\r\nin the most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will\r\nnot be wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive,\r\nand dressing them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.\r\n\r\nA very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I\r\nhighly esteem, was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter, to\r\noffer a refinement upon my scheme. He said, that many gentlemen of this\r\nkingdom, having of late destroyed their deer, he conceived that the\r\nwant of venison might be well supplied by the bodies of young lads and\r\nmaidens, not exceeding fourteen years of age, nor under twelve; so\r\ngreat a number of both sexes in every county being now ready to starve\r\nfor want of work and service: and these to be disposed of by their\r\nparents if alive, or otherwise by their nearest relations. But with due\r\ndeference to so excellent a friend, and so deserving a patriot, I\r\ncannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my\r\nAmerican acquaintance assured me from frequent experience, that their\r\nflesh was generally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys, by\r\ncontinual exercise, and their taste disagreeable, and to fatten them\r\nwould not answer the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think,\r\nwith humble submission, be a loss to the publick, because they soon\r\nwould become breeders themselves: and besides, it is not improbable\r\nthat some scrupulous people might be apt to censure such a practice,\r\n(although indeed very unjustly) as a little bordering upon cruelty,\r\nwhich, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest objection\r\nagainst any project, how well soever intended.\r\n\r\nBut in order to justify my friend, he confessed, that this expedient\r\nwas put into his head by the famous Psalmanaazor, a native of the\r\nisland Formosa, who came from thence to London, above twenty years ago,\r\nand in conversation told my friend, that in his country, when any young\r\nperson happened to be put to death, the executioner sold the carcass to\r\npersons of quality, as a prime dainty; and that, in his time, the body\r\nof a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an attempt to poison\r\nthe Emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty’s prime minister of\r\nstate, and other great mandarins of the court in joints from the\r\ngibbet, at four hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the\r\nsame use were made of several plump young girls in this town, who\r\nwithout one single groat to their fortunes, cannot stir abroad without\r\na chair, and appear at a playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries\r\nwhich they never will pay for, the kingdom would not be the worse.\r\n\r\nSome persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that\r\nvast number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed; and I\r\nhave been desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken, to\r\nease the nation of so grievous an incumbrance. But I am not in the\r\nleast pain upon that matter, because it is very well known, that they\r\nare every day dying, and rotting, by cold and famine, and filth, and\r\nvermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected. And as to the young\r\nlabourers, they are now in almost as hopeful a condition. They cannot\r\nget work, and consequently pine away from want of nourishment, to a\r\ndegree, that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common\r\nlabour, they have not strength to perform it, and thus the country and\r\nthemselves are happily delivered from the evils to come.\r\n\r\nI have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I\r\nthink the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and\r\nmany, as well as of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nFor first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the\r\nnumber of Papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal\r\nbreeders of the nation, as well as our most dangerous enemies, and who\r\nstay at home on purpose with a design to deliver the kingdom to the\r\nPretender, hoping to take their advantage by the absence of so many\r\ngood Protestants, who have chosen rather to leave their country, than\r\nstay at home and pay tithes against their conscience to an episcopal\r\ncurate.\r\n\r\nSecondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own,\r\nwhich by law may be made liable to a distress, and help to pay their\r\nlandlord’s rent, their corn and cattle being already seized, and money\r\na thing unknown.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Whereas the maintainance of a hundred thousand children, from\r\ntwo years old, and upwards, cannot be computed at less than ten\r\nshillings a piece per annum, the nation’s stock will be thereby\r\nencreased fifty thousand pounds per annum, besides the profit of a new\r\ndish, introduced to the tables of all gentlemen of fortune in the\r\nkingdom, who have any refinement in taste. And the money will circulate\r\namong our selves, the goods being entirely of our own growth and\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nFourthly, The constant breeders, besides the gain of eight shillings\r\nsterling per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the\r\ncharge of maintaining them after the first year.\r\n\r\nFifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns, where\r\nthe vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best\r\nreceipts for dressing it to perfection; and consequently have their\r\nhouses frequented by all the fine gentlemen, who justly value\r\nthemselves upon their knowledge in good eating; and a skilful cook, who\r\nunderstands how to oblige his guests, will contrive to make it as\r\nexpensive as they please.\r\n\r\nSixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise\r\nnations have either encouraged by rewards, or enforced by laws and\r\npenalties. It would encrease the care and tenderness of mothers towards\r\ntheir children, when they were sure of a settlement for life to the\r\npoor babes, provided in some sort by the publick, to their annual\r\nprofit instead of expence. We should soon see an honest emulation among\r\nthe married women, which of them could bring the fattest child to the\r\nmarket. Men would become as fond of their wives, during the time of\r\ntheir pregnancy, as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in\r\ncalf, or sows when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick\r\nthem (as is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.\r\n\r\nMany other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition\r\nof some thousand carcasses in our exportation of barrel’d beef: the\r\npropagation of swine’s flesh, and improvement in the art of making good\r\nbacon, so much wanted among us by the great destruction of pigs, too\r\nfrequent at our tables; which are no way comparable in taste or\r\nmagnificence to a well grown, fat yearling child, which roasted whole\r\nwill make a considerable figure at a Lord Mayor’s feast, or any other\r\npublick entertainment. But this, and many others, I omit, being\r\nstudious of brevity.\r\n\r\nSupposing that one thousand families in this city, would be constant\r\ncustomers for infants flesh, besides others who might have it at merry\r\nmeetings, particularly at weddings and christenings, I compute that\r\nDublin would take off annually about twenty thousand carcasses; and the\r\nrest of the kingdom (where probably they will be sold somewhat cheaper)\r\nthe remaining eighty thousand.\r\n\r\nI can think of no one objection, that will possibly be raised against\r\nthis proposal, unless it should be urged, that the number of people\r\nwill be thereby much lessened in the kingdom. This I freely own, and\r\nwas indeed one principal design in offering it to the world. I desire\r\nthe reader will observe, that I calculate my remedy for this one\r\nindividual Kingdom of Ireland, and for no other that ever was, is, or,\r\nI think, ever can be upon Earth. Therefore let no man talk to me of\r\nother expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of\r\nusing neither clothes, nor houshold furniture, except what is of our\r\nown growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and\r\ninstruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of\r\npride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein\r\nof parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country,\r\nwherein we differ even from Laplanders, and the inhabitants of\r\nTopinamboo: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any\r\nlonger like the Jews, who were murdering one another at the very moment\r\ntheir city was taken: Of being a little cautious not to sell our\r\ncountry and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at\r\nleast one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a\r\nspirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shopkeepers, who, if a\r\nresolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would\r\nimmediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure,\r\nand the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair\r\nproposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.\r\n\r\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like\r\nexpedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will\r\never be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.\r\n\r\nBut, as to myself, having been wearied out for many years with offering\r\nvain, idle, visionary thoughts, and at length utterly despairing of\r\nsuccess, I fortunately fell upon this proposal, which, as it is wholly\r\nnew, so it hath something solid and real, of no expence and little\r\ntrouble, full in our own power, and whereby we can incur no danger in\r\ndisobliging England. For this kind of commodity will not bear\r\nexportation, and flesh being of too tender a consistence, to admit a\r\nlong continuance in salt, although perhaps I could name a country,\r\nwhich would be glad to eat up our whole nation without it.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion, as to reject\r\nany offer, proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent,\r\ncheap, easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be\r\nadvanced in contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire\r\nthe author or authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points.\r\nFirst, As things now stand, how they will be able to find food and\r\nraiment for a hundred thousand useless mouths and backs. And secondly,\r\nThere being a round million of creatures in humane figure throughout\r\nthis kingdom, whose whole subsistence put into a common stock, would\r\nleave them in debt two million of pounds sterling, adding those who are\r\nbeggars by profession, to the bulk of farmers, cottagers and labourers,\r\nwith their wives and children, who are beggars in effect; I desire\r\nthose politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold\r\nto attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these\r\nmortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness\r\nto have been sold for food at a year old, in the manner I prescribe,\r\nand thereby have avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes, as they\r\nhave since gone through, by the oppression of landlords, the\r\nimpossibility of paying rent without money or trade, the want of common\r\nsustenance, with neither house nor clothes to cover them from the\r\ninclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable prospect of\r\nintailing the like, or greater miseries, upon their breed for ever.\r\n\r\nI profess in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least\r\npersonal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work,\r\nhaving no other motive than the publick good of my country, by\r\nadvancing our trade, providing for infants, relieving the poor, and\r\ngiving some pleasure to the rich. I have no children, by which I can\r\npropose to get a single penny; the youngest being nine years old, and\r\nmy wife past child-bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A MODEST PROPOSAL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1080-0.txt or 1080-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n    https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/8/1080/\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\r\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\r\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\r\nfrom people in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\r\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\r\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\r\nwww.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\r\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\r\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\r\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\r\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\r\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\r\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\r\nvolunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\r\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\r\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\r\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

		    "text": "The Importance of Being Earnest, by Oscar Wilde\r\n\r\nFIRST ACT\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE\r\n\r\nMorning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is\r\nluxuriously and artistically furnished. The sound of a piano is heard\r\nin the adjoining room.\r\n\r\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has\r\nceased, Algernon enters.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nDid you hear what I was playing, Lane?\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nI didn’t think it polite to listen, sir.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don’t play accurately—any one can\r\nplay accurately—but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the\r\npiano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\r\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\r\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\r\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\r\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWhy is it that at a bachelor’s establishment the servants invariably\r\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\r\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\r\nfirst-rate brand.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\r\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\r\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\r\na young person.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\n[Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family\r\nlife, Lane.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nLane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\r\ndon’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\r\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.\r\n\r\n[Enter Lane.]\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nMr. Ernest Worthing.\r\n\r\n[Enter Jack.]\r\n\r\n[Lane goes out_._]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nHow are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as\r\nusual, I see, Algy!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\n[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some\r\nslight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last\r\nThursday?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWhat on earth do you do there?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.\r\nWhen one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively\r\nboring.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nAnd who are the people you amuse?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nGot nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nPerfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nHow immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By\r\nthe way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nEh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber\r\nsandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is\r\ncoming to tea?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nOh! merely Aunt Augusta and Gwendolen.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nHow perfectly delightful!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes, that is all very well; but I am afraid Aunt Augusta won’t quite\r\napprove of your being here.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMay I ask why?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nMy dear fellow, the way you flirt with Gwendolen is perfectly\r\ndisgraceful. It is almost as bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI am in love with Gwendolen. I have come up to town expressly to\r\npropose to her.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI thought you had come up for pleasure? . . . I call that business.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nHow utterly unromantic you are!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI really don’t see anything romantic in proposing. It is very romantic\r\nto be in love. But there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal.\r\nWhy, one may be accepted. One usually is, I believe. Then the\r\nexcitement is all over. The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If\r\never I get married, I’ll certainly try to forget the fact.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce Court was specially\r\ninvented for people whose memories are so curiously constituted.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nOh! there is no use speculating on that subject. Divorces are made in\r\nHeaven—[Jack puts out his hand to take a sandwich. Algernon at once\r\ninterferes.] Please don’t touch the cucumber sandwiches. They are\r\nordered specially for Aunt Augusta. [Takes one and eats it.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, you have been eating them all the time.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThat is quite a different matter. She is my aunt. [Takes plate from\r\nbelow.] Have some bread and butter. The bread and butter is for\r\nGwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Advancing to table and helping himself.] And very good bread and\r\nbutter it is too.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, my dear fellow, you need not eat as if you were going to eat it\r\nall. You behave as if you were married to her already. You are not\r\nmarried to her already, and I don’t think you ever will be.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWhy on earth do you say that?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, in the first place girls never marry the men they flirt with.\r\nGirls don’t think it right.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, that is nonsense!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nIt isn’t. It is a great truth. It accounts for the extraordinary number\r\nof bachelors that one sees all over the place. In the second place, I\r\ndon’t give my consent.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYour consent!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nMy dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin. And before I allow you to\r\nmarry her, you will have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.\r\n[Rings bell.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nCecily! What on earth do you mean? What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily! I\r\ndon’t know any one of the name of Cecily.\r\n\r\n[Enter Lane.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nBring me that cigarette case Mr. Worthing left in the smoking-room the\r\nlast time he dined here.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir. [Lane goes out.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nDo you mean to say you have had my cigarette case all this time? I wish\r\nto goodness you had let me know. I have been writing frantic letters to\r\nScotland Yard about it. I was very nearly offering a large reward.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, I wish you would offer one. I happen to be more than usually hard\r\nup.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThere is no good offering a large reward now that the thing is found.\r\n\r\n[Enter Lane with the cigarette case on a salver. Algernon takes it at\r\nonce. Lane goes out.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI think that is rather mean of you, Ernest, I must say. [Opens case and\r\nexamines it.] However, it makes no matter, for, now that I look at the\r\ninscription inside, I find that the thing isn’t yours after all.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOf course it’s mine. [Moving to him.] You have seen me with it a\r\nhundred times, and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written\r\ninside. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nOh! it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what one should\r\nread and what one shouldn’t. More than half of modern culture depends\r\non what one shouldn’t read.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI am quite aware of the fact, and I don’t propose to discuss modern\r\nculture. It isn’t the sort of thing one should talk of in private. I\r\nsimply want my cigarette case back.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes; but this isn’t your cigarette case. This cigarette case is a\r\npresent from some one of the name of Cecily, and you said you didn’t\r\nknow any one of that name.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, if you want to know, Cecily happens to be my aunt.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYour aunt!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYes. Charming old lady she is, too. Lives at Tunbridge Wells. Just give\r\nit back to me, Algy.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\n[Retreating to back of sofa.] But why does she call herself little\r\nCecily if she is your aunt and lives at Tunbridge Wells? [Reading.]\r\n‘From little Cecily with her fondest love.’\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Moving to sofa and kneeling upon it.] My dear fellow, what on earth is\r\nthere in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a\r\nmatter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You\r\nseem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is\r\nabsurd! For Heaven’s sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows\r\nAlgernon round the room.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle? ‘From little Cecily,\r\nwith her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack.’ There is no objection, I\r\nadmit, to an aunt being a small aunt, but why an aunt, no matter what\r\nher size may be, should call her own nephew her uncle, I can’t quite\r\nmake out. Besides, your name isn’t Jack at all; it is Ernest.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nIt isn’t Ernest; it’s Jack.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYou have always told me it was Ernest. I have introduced you to every\r\none as Ernest. You answer to the name of Ernest. You look as if your\r\nname was Ernest. You are the most earnest-looking person I ever saw in\r\nmy life. It is perfectly absurd your saying that your name isn’t\r\nErnest. It’s on your cards. Here is one of them. [Taking it from case.]\r\n‘Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.’ I’ll keep this as a proof that\r\nyour name is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny it to me, or to\r\nGwendolen, or to any one else. [Puts the card in his pocket.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, my name is Ernest in town and Jack in the country, and the\r\ncigarette case was given to me in the country.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes, but that does not account for the fact that your small Aunt\r\nCecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells, calls you her dear uncle. Come,\r\nold boy, you had much better have the thing out at once.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMy dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were a dentist. It is very\r\nvulgar to talk like a dentist when one isn’t a dentist. It produces a\r\nfalse impression.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, that is exactly what dentists always do. Now, go on! Tell me the\r\nwhole thing. I may mention that I have always suspected you of being a\r\nconfirmed and secret Bunburyist; and I am quite sure of it now.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nBunburyist? What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI’ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon\r\nas you are kind enough to inform me why you are Ernest in town and Jack\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, produce my cigarette case first.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nHere it is. [Hands cigarette case.] Now produce your explanation, and\r\npray make it improbable. [Sits on sofa.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMy dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at\r\nall. In fact it’s perfectly ordinary. Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who\r\nadopted me when I was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his\r\ngrand-daughter, Miss Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me as her\r\nuncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate,\r\nlives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable\r\ngoverness, Miss Prism.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWhere is that place in the country, by the way?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThat is nothing to you, dear boy. You are not going to be invited . . .\r\nI may tell you candidly that the place is not in Shropshire.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI suspected that, my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire\r\non two separate occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest in town and\r\nJack in the country?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMy dear Algy, I don’t know whether you will be able to understand my\r\nreal motives. You are hardly serious enough. When one is placed in the\r\nposition of guardian, one has to adopt a very high moral tone on all\r\nsubjects. It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a high moral tone can hardly\r\nbe said to conduce very much to either one’s health or one’s happiness,\r\nin order to get up to town I have always pretended to have a younger\r\nbrother of the name of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets into\r\nthe most dreadful scrapes. That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth pure\r\nand simple.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThe truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very\r\ntedious if it were either, and modern literature a complete\r\nimpossibility!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThat wouldn’t be at all a bad thing.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nLiterary criticism is not your forte, my dear fellow. Don’t try it. You\r\nshould leave that to people who haven’t been at a University. They do\r\nit so well in the daily papers. What you really are is a Bunburyist. I\r\nwas quite right in saying you were a Bunburyist. You are one of the\r\nmost advanced Bunburyists I know.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWhat on earth do you mean?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYou have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order\r\nthat you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have\r\ninvented an invaluable permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that\r\nI may be able to go down into the country whenever I choose. Bunbury is\r\nperfectly invaluable. If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad\r\nhealth, for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s\r\nto-night, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than\r\na week.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere to-night.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is\r\nvery foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving\r\ninvitations.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYou had much better dine with your Aunt Augusta.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To\r\nbegin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to\r\ndine with one’s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine\r\nthere I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with\r\neither no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly\r\nwell whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next\r\nMary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the\r\ndinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent\r\n. . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount\r\nof women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly\r\nscandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one’s clean linen in\r\npublic. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I\r\nnaturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the\r\nrules.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI’m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to\r\nkill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a\r\nlittle too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going\r\nto get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.\r\n. . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nNothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get\r\nmarried, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad\r\nto know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very\r\ntedious time of it.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThat is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is\r\nthe only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly\r\nwon’t want to know Bunbury.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThen your wife will. You don’t seem to realise, that in married life\r\nthree is company and two is none.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Sententiously.] That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the\r\ncorrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes; and that the happy English home has proved in half the time.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nFor heaven’s sake, don’t try to be cynical. It’s perfectly easy to be\r\ncynical.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nMy dear fellow, it isn’t easy to be anything nowadays. There’s such a\r\nlot of beastly competition about. [The sound of an electric bell is\r\nheard.] Ah! that must be Aunt Augusta. Only relatives, or creditors,\r\never ring in that Wagnerian manner. Now, if I get her out of the way\r\nfor ten minutes, so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to\r\nGwendolen, may I dine with you to-night at Willis’s?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI suppose so, if you want to.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not\r\nserious about meals. It is so shallow of them.\r\n\r\n[Enter Lane.]\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nLady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.\r\n\r\n[Algernon goes forward to meet them. Enter Lady Bracknell and\r\nGwendolen.]\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nGood afternoon, dear Algernon, I hope you are behaving very well.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI’m feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nThat’s not quite the same thing. In fact the two things rarely go\r\ntogether. [Sees Jack and bows to him with icy coldness.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\n[To Gwendolen.] Dear me, you are smart!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nI am always smart! Am I not, Mr. Worthing?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYou’re quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nOh! I hope I am not that. It would leave no room for developments, and\r\nI intend to develop in many directions. [Gwendolen and Jack sit down\r\ntogether in the corner.]\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nI’m sorry if we are a little late, Algernon, but I was obliged to call\r\non dear Lady Harbury. I hadn’t been there since her poor husband’s\r\ndeath. I never saw a woman so altered; she looks quite twenty years\r\nyounger. And now I’ll have a cup of tea, and one of those nice cucumber\r\nsandwiches you promised me.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nCertainly, Aunt Augusta. [Goes over to tea-table.]\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nWon’t you come and sit here, Gwendolen?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nThanks, mamma, I’m quite comfortable where I am.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\n[Picking up empty plate in horror.] Good heavens! Lane! Why are there\r\nno cucumber sandwiches? I ordered them specially.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\n[Gravely.] There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir. I\r\nwent down twice.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nNo cucumbers!\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nNo, sir. Not even for ready money.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThat will do, Lane, thank you.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nThank you, sir. [Goes out.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta, about there being no cucumbers,\r\nnot even for ready money.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nIt really makes no matter, Algernon. I had some crumpets with Lady\r\nHarbury, who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nIt certainly has changed its colour. From what cause I, of course,\r\ncannot say. [Algernon crosses and hands tea.] Thank you. I’ve quite a\r\ntreat for you to-night, Algernon. I am going to send you down with Mary\r\nFarquhar. She is such a nice woman, and so attentive to her husband.\r\nIt’s delightful to watch them.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI am afraid, Aunt Augusta, I shall have to give up the pleasure of\r\ndining with you to-night after all.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\n[Frowning.] I hope not, Algernon. It would put my table completely out.\r\nYour uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nIt is a great bore, and, I need hardly say, a terrible disappointment\r\nto me, but the fact is I have just had a telegram to say that my poor\r\nfriend Bunbury is very ill again. [Exchanges glances with Jack.] They\r\nseem to think I should be with him.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nIt is very strange. This Mr. Bunbury seems to suffer from curiously bad\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes; poor Bunbury is a dreadful invalid.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nWell, I must say, Algernon, that I think it is high time that Mr.\r\nBunbury made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die. This\r\nshilly-shallying with the question is absurd. Nor do I in any way\r\napprove of the modern sympathy with invalids. I consider it morbid.\r\nIllness of any kind is hardly a thing to be encouraged in others.\r\nHealth is the primary duty of life. I am always telling that to your\r\npoor uncle, but he never seems to take much notice . . . as far as any\r\nimprovement in his ailment goes. I should be much obliged if you would\r\nask Mr. Bunbury, from me, to be kind enough not to have a relapse on\r\nSaturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music for me. It is my last\r\nreception, and one wants something that will encourage conversation,\r\nparticularly at the end of the season when every one has practically\r\nsaid whatever they had to say, which, in most cases, was probably not\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI’ll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta, if he is still conscious, and I\r\nthink I can promise you he’ll be all right by Saturday. Of course the\r\nmusic is a great difficulty. You see, if one plays good music, people\r\ndon’t listen, and if one plays bad music people don’t talk. But I’ll\r\nrun over the programme I’ve drawn out, if you will kindly come into the\r\nnext room for a moment.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nThank you, Algernon. It is very thoughtful of you. [Rising, and\r\nfollowing Algernon.] I’m sure the programme will be delightful, after a\r\nfew expurgations. French songs I cannot possibly allow. People always\r\nseem to think that they are improper, and either look shocked, which is\r\nvulgar, or laugh, which is worse. But German sounds a thoroughly\r\nrespectable language, and indeed, I believe is so. Gwendolen, you will\r\naccompany me.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nCertainly, mamma.\r\n\r\n[Lady Bracknell and Algernon go into the music-room, Gwendolen remains\r\nbehind.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nCharming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nPray don’t talk to me about the weather, Mr. Worthing. Whenever people\r\ntalk to me about the weather, I always feel quite certain that they\r\nmean something else. And that makes me so nervous.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI _do_ mean something else.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nI thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nAnd I would like to be allowed to take advantage of Lady Bracknell’s\r\ntemporary absence . . .\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nI would certainly advise you to do so. Mamma has a way of coming back\r\nsuddenly into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Nervously.] Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more\r\nthan any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nYes, I am quite well aware of the fact. And I often wish that in\r\npublic, at any rate, you had been more demonstrative. For me you have\r\nalways had an irresistible fascination. Even before I met you I was far\r\nfrom indifferent to you. [Jack looks at her in amazement.] We live, as\r\nI hope you know, Mr. Worthing, in an age of ideals. The fact is\r\nconstantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines, and has\r\nreached the provincial pulpits, I am told; and my ideal has always been\r\nto love some one of the name of Ernest. There is something in that name\r\nthat inspires absolute confidence. The moment Algernon first mentioned\r\nto me that he had a friend called Ernest, I knew I was destined to love\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYou really love me, Gwendolen?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nPassionately!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nDarling! You don’t know how happy you’ve made me.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nMy own Ernest!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nBut you don’t really mean to say that you couldn’t love me if my name\r\nwasn’t Ernest?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nBut your name is Ernest.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYes, I know it is. But supposing it was something else? Do you mean to\r\nsay you couldn’t love me then?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\n[Glibly.] Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most\r\nmetaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the\r\nactual facts of real life, as we know them.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nPersonally, darling, to speak quite candidly, I don’t much care about\r\nthe name of Ernest . . . I don’t think the name suits me at all.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nIt suits you perfectly. It is a divine name. It has a music of its own.\r\nIt produces vibrations.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, really, Gwendolen, I must say that I think there are lots of\r\nother much nicer names. I think Jack, for instance, a charming name.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nJack? . . . No, there is very little music in the name Jack, if any at\r\nall, indeed. It does not thrill. It produces absolutely no vibrations .\r\n. . I have known several Jacks, and they all, without exception, were\r\nmore than usually plain. Besides, Jack is a notorious domesticity for\r\nJohn! And I pity any woman who is married to a man called John. She\r\nwould probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a\r\nsingle moment’s solitude. The only really safe name is Ernest.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nGwendolen, I must get christened at once—I mean we must get married at\r\nonce. There is no time to be lost.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nMarried, Mr. Worthing?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Astounded.] Well . . . surely. You know that I love you, and you led\r\nme to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nI adore you. But you haven’t proposed to me yet. Nothing has been said\r\nat all about marriage. The subject has not even been touched on.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell . . . may I propose to you now?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nI think it would be an admirable opportunity. And to spare you any\r\npossible disappointment, Mr. Worthing, I think it only fair to tell you\r\nquite frankly before-hand that I am fully determined to accept you.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nGwendolen!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nYes, Mr. Worthing, what have you got to say to me?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYou know what I have got to say to you.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nYes, but you don’t say it.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nGwendolen, will you marry me? [Goes on his knees.]\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nOf course I will, darling. How long you have been about it! I am afraid\r\nyou have had very little experience in how to propose.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMy own one, I have never loved any one in the world but you.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nYes, but men often propose for practice. I know my brother Gerald does.\r\nAll my girl-friends tell me so. What wonderfully blue eyes you have,\r\nErnest! They are quite, quite, blue. I hope you will always look at me\r\njust like that, especially when there are other people present. [Enter\r\nLady Bracknell.]\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nMr. Worthing! Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent posture. It is most\r\nindecorous.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nMamma! [He tries to rise; she restrains him.] I must beg you to retire.\r\nThis is no place for you. Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nFinished what, may I ask?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nI am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma. [They rise together.]\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nPardon me, you are not engaged to any one. When you do become engaged\r\nto some one, I, or your father, should his health permit him, will\r\ninform you of the fact. An engagement should come on a young girl as a\r\nsurprise, pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is hardly a\r\nmatter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself . . . And now I\r\nhave a few questions to put to you, Mr. Worthing. While I am making\r\nthese inquiries, you, Gwendolen, will wait for me below in the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\n[Reproachfully.] Mamma!\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nIn the carriage, Gwendolen! [Gwendolen goes to the door. She and Jack\r\nblow kisses to each other behind Lady Bracknell’s back. Lady Bracknell\r\nlooks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was.\r\nFinally turns round.] Gwendolen, the carriage!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nYes, mamma. [Goes out, looking back at Jack.]\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\n[Sitting down.] You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.\r\n\r\n[Looks in her pocket for note-book and pencil.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\n[Pencil and note-book in hand.] I feel bound to tell you that you are\r\nnot down on my list of eligible young men, although I have the same\r\nlist as the dear Duchess of Bolton has. We work together, in fact.\r\nHowever, I am quite ready to enter your name, should your answers be\r\nwhat a really affectionate mother requires. Do you smoke?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, yes, I must admit I smoke.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nI am glad to hear it. A man should always have an occupation of some\r\nkind. There are far too many idle men in London as it is. How old are\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nTwenty-nine.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nA very good age to be married at. I have always been of opinion that a\r\nman who desires to get married should know either everything or\r\nnothing. Which do you know?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[After some hesitation.] I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nI am pleased to hear it. I do not approve of anything that tampers with\r\nnatural ignorance. Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit; touch it\r\nand the bloom is gone. The whole theory of modern education is\r\nradically unsound. Fortunately in England, at any rate, education\r\nproduces no effect whatsoever. If it did, it would prove a serious\r\ndanger to the upper classes, and probably lead to acts of violence in\r\nGrosvenor Square. What is your income?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nBetween seven and eight thousand a year.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\n[Makes a note in her book.] In land, or in investments?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nIn investments, chiefly.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nThat is satisfactory. What between the duties expected of one during\r\none’s lifetime, and the duties exacted from one after one’s death, land\r\nhas ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure. It gives one position,\r\nand prevents one from keeping it up. That’s all that can be said about\r\nland.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI have a country house with some land, of course, attached to it, about\r\nfifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I don’t depend on that for my\r\nreal income. In fact, as far as I can make out, the poachers are the\r\nonly people who make anything out of it.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nA country house! How many bedrooms? Well, that point can be cleared up\r\nafterwards. You have a town house, I hope? A girl with a simple,\r\nunspoiled nature, like Gwendolen, could hardly be expected to reside in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but it is let by the year to\r\nLady Bloxham. Of course, I can get it back whenever I like, at six\r\nmonths’ notice.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nLady Bloxham? I don’t know her.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, she goes about very little. She is a lady considerably advanced in\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nAh, nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character. What\r\nnumber in Belgrave Square?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n149.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\n[Shaking her head.] The unfashionable side. I thought there was\r\nsomething. However, that could easily be altered.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nDo you mean the fashion, or the side?\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\n[Sternly.] Both, if necessary, I presume. What are your politics?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, I am afraid I really have none. I am a Liberal Unionist.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nOh, they count as Tories. They dine with us. Or come in the evening, at\r\nany rate. Now to minor matters. Are your parents living?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI have lost both my parents.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nTo lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded as a misfortune; to\r\nlose both looks like carelessness. Who was your father? He was\r\nevidently a man of some wealth. Was he born in what the Radical papers\r\ncall the purple of commerce, or did he rise from the ranks of the\r\naristocracy?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI am afraid I really don’t know. The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said I\r\nhad lost my parents. It would be nearer the truth to say that my\r\nparents seem to have lost me . . . I don’t actually know who I am by\r\nbirth. I was . . . well, I was found.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nFound!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThe late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman of a very charitable and\r\nkindly disposition, found me, and gave me the name of Worthing, because\r\nhe happened to have a first-class ticket for Worthing in his pocket at\r\nthe time. Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nWhere did the charitable gentleman who had a first-class ticket for\r\nthis seaside resort find you?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Gravely.] In a hand-bag.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nA hand-bag?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Very seriously.] Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag—a somewhat\r\nlarge, black leather hand-bag, with handles to it—an ordinary hand-bag\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nIn what locality did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew come across this\r\nordinary hand-bag?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nIn the cloak-room at Victoria Station. It was given to him in mistake\r\nfor his own.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nThe cloak-room at Victoria Station?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYes. The Brighton line.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nThe line is immaterial. Mr. Worthing, I confess I feel somewhat\r\nbewildered by what you have just told me. To be born, or at any rate\r\nbred, in a hand-bag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to\r\ndisplay a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that\r\nreminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. And I\r\npresume you know what that unfortunate movement led to? As for the\r\nparticular locality in which the hand-bag was found, a cloak-room at a\r\nrailway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion—has\r\nprobably, indeed, been used for that purpose before now—but it could\r\nhardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in\r\ngood society.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMay I ask you then what you would advise me to do? I need hardly say I\r\nwould do anything in the world to ensure Gwendolen’s happiness.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nI would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing, to try and acquire some\r\nrelations as soon as possible, and to make a definite effort to produce\r\nat any rate one parent, of either sex, before the season is quite over.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, I don’t see how I could possibly manage to do that. I can produce\r\nthe hand-bag at any moment. It is in my dressing-room at home. I really\r\nthink that should satisfy you, Lady Bracknell.\r\n\r\nLADY BRACKNELL.\r\nMe, sir! What has it to do with me? You can hardly imagine that I and\r\nLord Bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter—a girl brought\r\nup with the utmost care—to marry into a cloak-room, and form an\r\nalliance with a parcel? Good morning, Mr. Worthing!\r\n\r\n[Lady Bracknell sweeps out in majestic indignation.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nGood morning! [Algernon, from the other room, strikes up the Wedding\r\nMarch. Jack looks perfectly furious, and goes to the door.] For\r\ngoodness’ sake don’t play that ghastly tune, Algy. How idiotic you are!\r\n\r\n[The music stops and Algernon enters cheerily.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nDidn’t it go off all right, old boy? You don’t mean to say Gwendolen\r\nrefused you? I know it is a way she has. She is always refusing people.\r\nI think it is most ill-natured of her.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far as she is concerned, we\r\nare engaged. Her mother is perfectly unbearable. Never met such a\r\nGorgon . . . I don’t really know what a Gorgon is like, but I am quite\r\nsure that Lady Bracknell is one. In any case, she is a monster, without\r\nbeing a myth, which is rather unfair . . . I beg your pardon, Algy, I\r\nsuppose I shouldn’t talk about your own aunt in that way before you.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nMy dear boy, I love hearing my relations abused. It is the only thing\r\nthat makes me put up with them at all. Relations are simply a tedious\r\npack of people, who haven’t got the remotest knowledge of how to live,\r\nnor the smallest instinct about when to die.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, that is nonsense!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nIt isn’t!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWell, I won’t argue about the matter. You always want to argue about\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThat is exactly what things were originally made for.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nUpon my word, if I thought that, I’d shoot myself . . . [A pause.] You\r\ndon’t think there is any chance of Gwendolen becoming like her mother\r\nin about a hundred and fifty years, do you, Algy?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nAll women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man\r\ndoes. That’s his.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nIs that clever?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nIt is perfectly phrased! and quite as true as any observation in\r\ncivilised life should be.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI am sick to death of cleverness. Everybody is clever nowadays. You\r\ncan’t go anywhere without meeting clever people. The thing has become\r\nan absolute public nuisance. I wish to goodness we had a few fools\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWe have.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI should extremely like to meet them. What do they talk about?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThe fools? Oh! about the clever people, of course.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nWhat fools!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nBy the way, did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your being Ernest in\r\ntown, and Jack in the country?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[In a very patronising manner.] My dear fellow, the truth isn’t quite\r\nthe sort of thing one tells to a nice, sweet, refined girl. What\r\nextraordinary ideas you have about the way to behave to a woman!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThe only way to behave to a woman is to make love to her, if she is\r\npretty, and to some one else, if she is plain.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, that is nonsense.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWhat about your brother? What about the profligate Ernest?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, before the end of the week I shall have got rid of him. I’ll say he\r\ndied in Paris of apoplexy. Lots of people die of apoplexy, quite\r\nsuddenly, don’t they?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nYes, but it’s hereditary, my dear fellow. It’s a sort of thing that\r\nruns in families. You had much better say a severe chill.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYou are sure a severe chill isn’t hereditary, or anything of that kind?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nOf course it isn’t!\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nVery well, then. My poor brother Ernest is carried off suddenly, in\r\nParis, by a severe chill. That gets rid of him.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nBut I thought you said that . . . Miss Cardew was a little too much\r\ninterested in your poor brother Ernest? Won’t she feel his loss a good\r\ndeal?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, that is all right. Cecily is not a silly romantic girl, I am glad\r\nto say. She has got a capital appetite, goes long walks, and pays no\r\nattention at all to her lessons.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI would rather like to see Cecily.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI will take very good care you never do. She is excessively pretty, and\r\nshe is only just eighteen.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nHave you told Gwendolen yet that you have an excessively pretty ward\r\nwho is only just eighteen?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh! one doesn’t blurt these things out to people. Cecily and Gwendolen\r\nare perfectly certain to be extremely great friends. I’ll bet you\r\nanything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be\r\ncalling each other sister.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWomen only do that when they have called each other a lot of other\r\nthings first. Now, my dear boy, if we want to get a good table at\r\nWillis’s, we really must go and dress. Do you know it is nearly seven?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[Irritably.] Oh! It always is nearly seven.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, I’m hungry.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nI never knew you when you weren’t . . .\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWhat shall we do after dinner? Go to a theatre?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh no! I loathe listening.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, let us go to the Club?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, no! I hate talking.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, we might trot round to the Empire at ten?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, no! I can’t bear looking at things. It is so silly.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nWell, what shall we do?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nNothing!\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nIt is awfully hard work doing nothing. However, I don’t mind hard work\r\nwhere there is no definite object of any kind.\r\n\r\n[Enter Lane.]\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nMiss Fairfax.\r\n\r\n[Enter Gwendolen. Lane goes out.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nGwendolen, upon my word!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nAlgy, kindly turn your back. I have something very particular to say to\r\nMr. Worthing.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nReally, Gwendolen, I don’t think I can allow this at all.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nAlgy, you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards life. You\r\nare not quite old enough to do that. [Algernon retires to the\r\nfireplace.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMy own darling!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nErnest, we may never be married. From the expression on mamma’s face I\r\nfear we never shall. Few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their\r\nchildren say to them. The old-fashioned respect for the young is fast\r\ndying out. Whatever influence I ever had over mamma, I lost at the age\r\nof three. But although she may prevent us from becoming man and wife,\r\nand I may marry some one else, and marry often, nothing that she can\r\npossibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nDear Gwendolen!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nThe story of your romantic origin, as related to me by mamma, with\r\nunpleasing comments, has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my\r\nnature. Your Christian name has an irresistible fascination. The\r\nsimplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to\r\nme. Your town address at the Albany I have. What is your address in the\r\ncountry?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThe Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.\r\n\r\n[Algernon, who has been carefully listening, smiles to himself, and\r\nwrites the address on his shirt-cuff. Then picks up the Railway Guide.]\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nThere is a good postal service, I suppose? It may be necessary to do\r\nsomething desperate. That of course will require serious consideration.\r\nI will communicate with you daily.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nMy own one!\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nHow long do you remain in town?\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nTill Monday.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nGood! Algy, you may turn round now.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nThanks, I’ve turned round already.\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nYou may also ring the bell.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nYou will let me see you to your carriage, my own darling?\r\n\r\nGWENDOLEN.\r\nCertainly.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\n[To Lane, who now enters.] I will see Miss Fairfax out.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir. [Jack and Gwendolen go off.]\r\n\r\n[Lane presents several letters on a salver to Algernon. It is to be\r\nsurmised that they are bills, as Algernon, after looking at the\r\nenvelopes, tears them up.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nA glass of sherry, Lane.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nTo-morrow, Lane, I’m going Bunburying.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI shall probably not be back till Monday. You can put up my dress\r\nclothes, my smoking jacket, and all the Bunbury suits . . .\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nYes, sir. [Handing sherry.]\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI hope to-morrow will be a fine day, Lane.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nIt never is, sir.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nLane, you’re a perfect pessimist.\r\n\r\nLANE.\r\nI do my best to give satisfaction, sir.\r\n\r\n[Enter Jack. Lane goes off.]\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nThere’s a sensible, intellectual girl! the only girl I ever cared for\r\nin my life. [Algernon is laughing immoderately.] What on earth are you\r\nso amused at?\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nOh, I’m a little anxious about poor Bunbury, that is all.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nIf you don’t take care, your friend Bunbury will get you into a serious\r\nscrape some day.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nI love scrapes. They are the only things that are never serious.\r\n\r\nJACK.\r\nOh, that’s nonsense, Algy. You never talk anything but nonsense.\r\n\r\nALGERNON.\r\nNobody ever does.\r\n\r\n[Jack looks indignantly at him, and leaves the room. Algernon lights a\r\ncigarette, reads his shirt-cuff, and smiles.]\r\n\r\nACT DROP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ACT\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE\r\n\r\nGarden at the Manor House. A flight of grey stone steps leads up to the\r\nhouse. The garden, an old-fashioned one, full of roses. Time of year,\r\nJuly. Basket chairs, and a table covered with books, are set under a\r\nlarge yew-tree.\r\n\r\n[Miss Prism discovered seated at the table. Cecily is at the back\r\nwatering flowers.]\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\n[Calling.] Cecily, Cecily! Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the\r\nwatering of flowers is rather Moulton’s duty than yours? Especially at\r\na moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is\r\non the table. Pray open it at page fifteen. We will repeat yesterday’s\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\n[Coming over very slowly.] But I don’t like German. It isn’t at all a\r\nbecoming language. I know perfectly well that I look quite plain after\r\nmy German lesson.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nChild, you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve\r\nyourself in every way. He laid particular stress on your German, as he\r\nwas leaving for town yesterday. Indeed, he always lays stress on your\r\nGerman when he is leaving for town.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nDear Uncle Jack is so very serious! Sometimes he is so serious that I\r\nthink he cannot be quite well.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\n[Drawing herself up.] Your guardian enjoys the best of health, and his\r\ngravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in one so\r\ncomparatively young as he is. I know no one who has a higher sense of\r\nduty and responsibility.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nI suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nCecily! I am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his\r\nlife. Idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his\r\nconversation. You must remember his constant anxiety about that\r\nunfortunate young man his brother.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nI wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate young man, his brother,\r\nto come down here sometimes. We might have a good influence over him,\r\nMiss Prism. I am sure you certainly would. You know German, and\r\ngeology, and things of that kind influence a man very much. [Cecily\r\nbegins to write in her diary.]\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\n[Shaking her head.] I do not think that even I could produce any effect\r\non a character that according to his own brother’s admission is\r\nirretrievably weak and vacillating. Indeed I am not sure that I would\r\ndesire to reclaim him. I am not in favour of this modern mania for\r\nturning bad people into good people at a moment’s notice. As a man sows\r\nso let him reap. You must put away your diary, Cecily. I really don’t\r\nsee why you should keep a diary at all.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nI keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my life. If I\r\ndidn’t write them down, I should probably forget all about them.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nMemory, my dear Cecily, is the diary that we all carry about with us.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nYes, but it usually chronicles the things that have never happened, and\r\ncouldn’t possibly have happened. I believe that Memory is responsible\r\nfor nearly all the three-volume novels that Mudie sends us.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nDo not speak slightingly of the three-volume novel, Cecily. I wrote one\r\nmyself in earlier days.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nDid you really, Miss Prism? How wonderfully clever you are! I hope it\r\ndid not end happily? I don’t like novels that end happily. They depress\r\nme so much.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nThe good ended happily, and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nI suppose so. But it seems very unfair. And was your novel ever\r\npublished?\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nAlas! no. The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned. [Cecily starts.]\r\nI use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid. To your work, child,\r\nthese speculations are profitless.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\n[Smiling.] But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\n[Rising and advancing.] Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.\r\n\r\n[Enter Canon Chasuble.]\r\n\r\nCHASUBLE.\r\nAnd how are we this morning? Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nMiss Prism has just been complaining of a slight headache. I think it\r\nwould do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the Park,\r\nDr. Chasuble.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nCecily, I have not mentioned anything about a headache.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nNo, dear Miss Prism, I know that, but I felt instinctively that you had\r\na headache. Indeed I was thinking about that, and not about my German\r\nlesson, when the Rector came in.\r\n\r\nCHASUBLE.\r\nI hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\nOh, I am afraid I am.\r\n\r\nCHASUBLE.\r\nThat is strange. Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism’s pupil, I\r\nwould hang upon her lips. [Miss Prism glares.] I spoke\r\nmetaphorically.—My metaphor was drawn from bees. Ahem! Mr. Worthing, I\r\nsuppose, has not returned from town yet?\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nWe do not expect him till Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\nCHASUBLE.\r\nAh yes, he usually likes to spend his Sunday in London. He is not one\r\nof those whose sole aim is enjoyment, as, by all accounts, that\r\nunfortunate young man his brother seems to be. But I must not disturb\r\nEgeria and her pupil any longer.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nEgeria? My name is Lætitia, Doctor.\r\n\r\nCHASUBLE.\r\n[Bowing.] A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors. I\r\nshall see you both no doubt at Evensong?\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nI think, dear Doctor, I will have a stroll with you. I find I have a\r\nheadache after all, and a walk might do it good.\r\n\r\nCHASUBLE.\r\nWith pleasure, Miss Prism, with pleasure. We might go as far as the\r\nschools and back.\r\n\r\nMISS PRISM.\r\nThat would be delightful. Cecily, you will read your Political Economy\r\nin my absence. The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee you may omit. It is\r\nsomewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their\r\nmelodramatic side.\r\n\r\n[Goes down the garden with Dr. Chasuble.]\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\n[Picks up books and throws them back on table.] Horrid Political\r\nEconomy! Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!\r\n\r\n[Enter Merriman with a card on a salver.]\r\n\r\nMERRIMAN.\r\nMr. Ernest Worthing has just driven over from the station. He has\r\nbrought his luggage with him.\r\n\r\nCECILY.\r\n[Takes the card "
